Giving this a neutral rating because it's really a long-form essay rather than a book (I read it in a single short sitting). I wanted more history/data brought into the text from the references, except there aren't any references since it's an essay. As an essay though, good overview of Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria if you don't know anything about it (which I didn't).

Probably helps that I've read most of her previous books (in particular Shock Doctrine), which this essay builds on.
