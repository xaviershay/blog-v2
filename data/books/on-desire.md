Very easy to read, with a good balance between explanation and stories. Didn't get a large amount of new material out of it, but was worthwhile for what I did:
- Distinction between hedonistic and non-hedonistic, terminal and non-terminal desires
- Whole chapter on protestant approaches to desire (Amish), how they place community above all else, and the different ways they approach sex and celibacy.
