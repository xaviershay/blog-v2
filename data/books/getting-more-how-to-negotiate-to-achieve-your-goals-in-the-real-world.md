Fantastic book written by a guy who was involved in the "Getting To Yes" project 20 years ago, and has been a professional negotiator ever since. A lot has changed in theory/practice! Picked up a lot from this book, everything from buying a car to dealing with kids.

"First, done right, there is no difference between “negotiation,” “persuasion,” “communication,” or “selling.” They all should have the same process. That is, they should start with goals, focus on people, and be situational."
