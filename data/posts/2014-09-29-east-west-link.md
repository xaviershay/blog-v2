Tonight I'm reading about East West Link and Melbourne Rail. This was triggered by news that Napthine signed a secret contract [granting millions in special compensation to the builder in event of cancellation](http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/napthine-grants-millions-in-special-compensation-for-east-west-link-after-builder-threatens-to-walk-20140929-10nqg6.html). That seems pretty bullshit given labor has pledged to drop the contract if it wins the election later this year.

This post is a collection of reading I found useful.

First, [a map](http://www.linkingmelbourne.vic.gov.au/maps/east-west-link) of where the tunnel would be:

Not shown is a large amount of extra widening of Citylink on the western side that is included in the project.

Many damning things have been said about the road in [public hearings][public-hearing], including criticisms of the lack of rigour (and therefore accuracy) in any part of the planning, impact assessment, or approval process.

[Support for the road][support] comes from obvious sources. Note the lack of people in the following, and the truism of motoring organisations supporting a new road.

One of many objections to the road is that we should be investing in public transport instead. I was curious what the state of the old Metro plan was after it was classified ["Ready to proceed"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Rail_Capacity_Project) by goverment advisory board Infrastructure Australia back in 2010.

Napthine has replaced it with the Melbourne Rail Link. Seems to be [useless churn][bowen], but [not too offensive as a plan][crikey]. At least rail is seeing some investment. I'm not exactly sure what it means coming from a government outlet, but apparently Melbourne Rail Link is ["fully funded"](http://www.transport.vic.gov.au/projects/melbourne-rail-link/melbourne-rail-link-frequently-asked-questions).
