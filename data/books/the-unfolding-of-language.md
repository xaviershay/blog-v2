Loved it. Super interesting, very well presented. I learned many things.

"It took a long time before linguists managed to show that the forces of creation are not confined to remote prehistory, but are alive and kicking even in modern languages."

Almost lost a star for the socratic dialogue in the middle, but made it up again with the subchapter heading "SEXED TURNIPS AND OTHER IRREGULARITIES"
