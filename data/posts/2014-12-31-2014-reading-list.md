I read sixty-one books this year, [five fewer than last](2013-reading-list.html). You can find the full list over at [Good Reads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/2875383-xavier-shay?utf8=%E2%9C%93&read_at=2014&view=covers&per_page=100). Here are my top picks.

## Non-fiction

#### The Glass Cage _by Nicolas Carr_

What if the cost of machines that think is people who donâ€™t? An must-read
for everyone in tech. It is not anti-technology, but raises some important
questions about how technology is changing society. I [reviewed this in
full](the-glass-cage-review.html) earlier in the year.

#### This Changes Everything _by Naomi Klein_

Damning yet uplifting book about the state of our climate. It savages everyone
from fossil fuel companies to futurists to billionaire do-gooders, before
turning in the second half to cover the many successes of climate movements
around the world. Inspired me to learn more, engage more, and write more.

#### The Hard Thing About Hard Things _by Ben Horowitz_

Perhaps the best business book I've read. Real-talk from a CEO in the trenches.
I'm not usually a fan of blog post collections, but there is enough glue and
cohesion here to make it work.

## Skills

#### Non-violent Communication _by Marshall Rosenberg_

Rosenberg has well over three decades of experience coaching difficult
conversations. He delivers it well. Key takeaway is to be able to identify
needs and how they drive feelings, and to then using them to find common
ground, particularly when you disagree strongly with someone. Also, people want
to be _heard_, not fixed or advised.

#### Several short sentences about writing _by Verlyn Klinkenborg_

Original review: "Could have done with a couple of paragraphs." It has had a
lasting impact on my writing though, and in hindsight I rate it much higher
than I did when I first read it. Skim over the middle section to get to the
enjoyable sentence critiques in the final chapter.

## Law

I became interested in Law this year after stumbling across the excellent
[_Surveillance Law_](https://www.coursera.org/course/surveillance) subject on
Coursera. Naturally, I read some books about it.

#### The Legal Analyst _by Ward Farnsworth_

Great introductory book. Frames many familiar concepts from game theory,
economics, and cognitive science within the context of law. Each of the
thirty-one chapters are short, clearly written, and contain many
recommendations for further reading.

#### Reflections on Judging _by Richard Possner_

Possner has been an appeals judge for over thirty years. His topics are
wide-ranging: from an increasingly technically illiterate judiciary, to the
rise of formalist textualism, to managerial issues within appelate courts, to
judges who have never learned to write. His opinions are clear, hard-hitting,
and very entertaining.

## Fiction

I made a successful effort to read more fiction this year. I doubled my rate
from last year, up to 30%. Fiction is great!

#### The Narrow Road to the Deep North _by Richard Flanagan_

Made me realise how long it has been since I read any Australian literature.
Centered around a POW camp building the Thai-Burma death railway, it is both
tragic and beautiful.

#### A Fine Balance _by Rohinton Mistry_

Set in 1975 India during the state emergency.  Another amazingly depressing
novel I couldn't put down.

#### Cat's Cradle _by Kurt Vonnegut_

Time for something a bit lighter. I'm not generally a huge Vonnegut fan, so was
surprised how much I enjoyed this.

#### Self-Help _by Lorrie Moore_

Nine short stories, funny and sad all at the same time. The first Moore book
I've read, and I plan to read more.

## Bonus Section: Documentaries

In addition to reading, I watched a number of documentaries this year. The standouts were all by Marshall Curry. I reviewed [_If A Tree Falls_](http://localhost:4000/blog/articles/if-a-tree-falls.html) previously, and [_Street Fight_](http://www.marshallcurry.com/street_fight.html) and [_Racing Dreams_](http://www.marshallcurry.com/racing_dreams.html) were also both excellent.

Josh Fox's [_Gasland_](http://www.palacefilms.com.au/gasland/) earns an
honourable mention, which I watched as part of a [fracking
binge](fracking.html) back in October.
