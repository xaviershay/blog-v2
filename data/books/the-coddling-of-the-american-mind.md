I didn't realise the extent to which things had changed on campuses in the last few years.

Not a lot of new content in here if you've read previous books from Haldt (co-author), but it's short and well written. Probably could have just read the article.

Overall, makes the point that universities need to be motivated by truth, not activism - which I find compelling. Gyms, not luxury resorts.  Which meant many potentially interesting issues weren't covered, e.g. deplatforming is bad in this framework, but can be effective, how to think through from an activist perspective?
