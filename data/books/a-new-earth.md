First part of the book I didn't get anything specifically new out of, but it triggered a lot of reflection so worth reading. (Maybe the "pain-body" concept, but not sure how useful a metaphor it is for me.)

Last two chapters were excellent and provided some new metaphors. They justify reading this book in themselves. Key points:
- Do everything with either acceptance, enjoyment, or enthusiasm.
- "Inner" purpose is achieving Presence/Being/whatever, same for everyone. "Outer" purpose is not only different for people, but will change for one person over their lifetime. Outer purpose builds on inner purpose, rather than being ego driven.
