a thousand pages of very pretty writing, that is often gratuitous and goes nowhere. 3 stars because it has very good parts, but I was reading it for a month and wanted to throw it into the fire more than once. Reading the five parts separately, with space in between, would have improved the experience I think.

(.... sorry jaidee)
