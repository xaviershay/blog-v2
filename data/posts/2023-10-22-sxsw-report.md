### Can Data Save Democrary?

#### Panelists


#### Key Theme

Transparency in government, particularly through making data available, is one
of the critical ways we can rebuild waning trust in government. Trust in
government is critical for strong democracy.

#### Speaker Points

* Our federal FOI process is shit.
* Need truth in political advertising laws at a federal level, and there is a
  bill in train at the moment for htat. But also the amount of damage an
  individual can do with a smartphone is rapidly increasing and we need to be
  wary of that.
* Need regulation and standards for journalists the same way we do for doctors
  and lawyers. Trust in media is so important.
* Need to support local media organisations. The bill to force e.g. Google & Meta
  to compensate orgs for using their content good step forward --- $200m paid in
  first year --- but most of that goes to Newscorp.
* Feels like we're importing "US style" politics, but that's not who we are as
  Australians.  Need to balance free speech with responsibility.
* Digital Identify is one of the strongest things we need, giving people
  control over their data.
* Government must be Hypervigilant when it comes to transparency. Politicians
  love cutting ribbons, but need to start cutting transparency ribbons. Need to
  be excited by it.
* NSW leading the way on sharing data. In particular, restricted data into
  communities. Saw this so powerfully during COVID, health didn't want to
  disclose data about transmission on virus, but transparency prevailed.
* We've already got filters in place for explicit material. In a better world,
  why couldn't we apply filters to verifiable sources?


> They're doing it in Singapore. If we don't show people, they won't trust us.

#### My Reflections

* News organisations maybe need to rethink how they present? Why do I find
  "rando on Tiktok presenting seemingly nuanced analysis" more compelling than
  "read an article in a newspaper". Feels like an opportunity? NPR economics
  podcast(?) does a decent job of this, The Daily Aus also. Adapting to new
  ways of consumption is critical: I'm not going to set aside time to read a
  newspaper cover to cover, but am very happy having news show up in my feed.
* How do we reconcile "rebuild trust in media" with "newscorp can't be trusted"?
* Want to learn more about the types of restricted data Seer are making
  available and what that's leading to.
* Digital Identity is critical ... but can't really make the link to
  trust in government.
* Appreciate link between filtering explicit and trustworthy ... but also don't
  know to even approach that until we sort out the "Newscorp problem".

### Finance Industry Emergence

#### Key Theme

Finance industry is uniquely conflicted and an large and present threat to
society.

#### Speaker Points

* Finance is a uniquely extractive industry. Only industry selling same thing
  that shareholders want, creates a conflict between customers and shareholders
  that doesn't exist in other industries.
* When buying a coffee or shoes, customer well positioned to evaluate value.
  For financial products, it's an 80 page PDS.
* Need to treat providing basic financial products the same as we do providing
  clean water.
* Poor people don't make bad decisions. Bad decisions are made when people are
  poor. Financial stress can lead to 13 point IQ drop.
* Industry not thinking about risk like an engineer would. Too reliant on human
  processes and administrative work as controls, rather than prevention.
  (Commissions good example of a process that will always fail eventually.)
* Getting rid of commissions is one of the best things we could do to improve
  situation. Move to pay upfront model for broker services.
* Need to change non-executive director responsibilities and incentives. Right
  now they are too afraid to take any risk on non-financial outcomes.
* Many comparison tools are sales funnels. And they are the ones with the best
  SEO.
* MoneySmart (ASIC/government program) isn't working. Refuse to refer out
  (because of conflict) but that means it can't be too useful. They're managing
  risk well, but not delivering the service they used to.
* Financial education has been in curriculum for 12 years, but financial
  literacy outcomes have gone backwards 6 months. Everything government touches
  hasn't worked. Not the people to lead it. Also can't be people who sell
  financial products. Who then?
* Monash offer the only Master of Indigenous Business Leadership, for
  indigenous Australians, looking in particular to learn from different
  perspectives.
* Need to help people best play the hand they are dealth, but personal
  responsibility approach to finance isn't going to get us there.
* International Accounting Standards board merged with Sustainable Standards
  Board, which should be good but still too focused on financial measures.
* Government provides social welfare to 3 million people. Same people finance
  industry gives payday loans to.
* 32% of all women liven in 25% of poorest households, only 16% live in
  wealthiest 25%.
* Need to lift everyone out of poverty even just on economic grounds, but some
  concern that our planet can't support increasing levels of consumption. Needs
  to be a redistribution from top 10%.

#### My Reflections

* Not sure I agree finance is uniquely extractive. Same incentives to pass on
  bad products to customers in pursuit of product exist everywhere?
* Simarly with "no one reads PDS" argument, true of all T&Cs? Doesn't matter to
  wider point though I don't think: arguments don't rely on finance being
  _unique_ in this regard, just on it being big and central --- which it
  inarguably is.
* From Up's perspective (and Maslow?), weaving "we do the right thing for
  customers" into our brand ties our hands in some positive ways e.g. we don't
  feel like we could release "just another personal credit product", despite
  that being a traditionally "obvious" move in our position.

### AWS thing

#### Key Theme

Amazon has a well developed culture and set of leadership principles designed
to enable innovation.

#### Speaker Points

I didn't stay for the whole session, but he was primarily presenting Amazon's leadership
principles which are freely available online.

> Books are the most complicated and diverse type of thing you can sell -- more
> individual items than any other category. If we can solve that, we can solve
> anything.

#### My Reflections

None of the content was new -- I worked with many ex-Amazonians at Square and
am familiar with these principles in practice. But it was good to have it
packaged up to force some reflection, primarily that there are a few that I
have in my head but haven't discussed explicitly enough with current team.

Overall a strong presentation.

### NASA's Artemis program: Australia's role in the moon to mars mission

#### Key Theme

Humans are going to Mars.

#### Speaker Points

* Artemis is the codename for missions leading up to putting humans on Mars.
* Artemis 1 completed a successful flyby of the moon and splashdown in December. This was a 25 day mission and was a great success: completed 24 bonus flight objectives on top of the 121 scheduled. Primary focus was on crew safety. Of great interest was how new heat sheilding would perform, re-entering the atmosphere at Mach 32 and dealing temperatures half that the surface of the sun.
* Looking to put a person on the moon again in 2025.
* Main thing we learned from last moon landing that we're spending a lot of time on solutions for is the "Lunar regolith", aka "moon dust". It's almost like shredded glass.
* Last time was very country focused. This time we have international accords which currently have 29 countries signed up.
* This time we're going to the south pole rather than the equatorial region. Science is different there, expect that an older history of the universe is captured there.
