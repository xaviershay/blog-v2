Engaging and scary read about the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Mostly technical details (i.e. where the safety systems came from, just how often armed B52 bombers crashed/exploded/accidentally dropped something they shouldn't have), but enough political stuff that you can follow along if you didn't grow up in the Cold War.
