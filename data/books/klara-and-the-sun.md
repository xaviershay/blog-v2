Was mostly just mildly interested for most of the book but really liked where it ended up and felt it was pretty unique contribution to the THEMES. A book I enjoy having read, much more than the process of reading it. Not that the writing is bad - it's actually great - but it only kept me sufficiently curious to keep reading in between other books without being a page turner.
