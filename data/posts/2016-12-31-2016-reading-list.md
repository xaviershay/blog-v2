I read fifty-seven books this year, [the least of the last five years](2015-reading-list.html). I did watch more films and series though, as well as a couple of video games. I included a bonus section for those. You can find the full list of books over at [Good Reads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/2875383-xavier-shay?utf8=%E2%9C%93&read_at=2016&view=covers&per_page=100). Here are my top picks.

## Non-fiction

#### Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind _by Yuval Noah Harari_

Book of the year. Highly engaging and raises more questions than it answers.
The author posits that the appearance of fiction and common myths was likely
the catalyst to enable large groups of Homo Sapiens to start working together
to form cities and empires, and then explores how various myths have since
impacted our species – including monotheism, capitalism, liberalism, and more.

> There are no gods in the universe, no nations, no money, no human rights, no
> laws, and no justice outside the common imagination of human beings.

#### Fast Food Nation _by Eric Schlosser_

This book has been on my list for years, and it finally got a guernsey recently
when I noticed the author was that of _Command and Control_, which made my list
last year. It's a similar style of book: in-depth but very readable overview of
the fast food industry. Scary.

#### The Corner _by David Simon_

Before he wrote _The Wire_, Simon spent a year on a Baltimore corner and wrote
this book about it. An extraordinary and hard-hitting piece of journalism. The
chapter on teen pregnancy among poverty is particularly striking.

> Most of these babies are very much wanted by the mothers and fathers alike.
> What better legacy for a sixteen-year-old slinger who expects to be dead or
> in prison by age twenty? What greater personal justification for a teenaged
> girl thirsting for the unequivocal love of another being?

> DeAnte Tyree McCullough enters this world at 4:15 P.M. on Thanksgiving Day,
> crying like he knows the whole story.

## Skills

#### Getting More _by Stuart Diamond_

I was lucky enough to hear the author talk earlier this year. He was involved
in the birth of the Harvard Negotiation Project, back in 1981 when they
published [_Getting To
Yes_](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Yes-Negotiating-Agreement-Without/dp/0395631246),
and has continued in that field ever since. This book covers everything from
buying a car to dealing with kids, and includes criticisms and alternatives to
strategies from _Getting To Yes_ such as
[BATNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_alternative_to_a_negotiated_agreement).

#### How Bad Do You Want It _by Matt Fitzgerald_

Excellent look at the psychology of endurance sports, including much recent
research combined with athlete stories. Still a very early field, since for so
long science focused on purely physical capabilities. It's only recently that
we've started to study grit, perserverance, and other attributes that have
historically been considered intangibles.

> There is no experience quite like that of driving yourself to the point of
> wanting to give up and then not giving up.

Also, this book will make you want to go for a run.

## Fiction

#### Where'd You Go Bernadette _by Maria Semple_

Interesting characters and style, good plot that kept me guessing, unconventional pacing, funny, sad.

#### Glow _by Ned Beauman_

I don't know what to say about it so I'll just quote it:

> The sound system isn’t even that loud but the room’s so small that the treble pushes at the sides like a fat toddler stuffed into a car seat.

_Boxer, Beetle_, by the same author, was also quite good.

#### Red Rising Trilogy _by Pierce Brown_

The only trilogy epic I've finished in a long while. Lot of suspense and action, good enough writing to carry it. More violent than I'd typically endorse, but it didn't feel _too_ gratuitous. Hard to put down.

## Bonus: Alternative Media

#### Sicario _by Denis Villeneuve_

It's parts are greater than the whole, but it's worth watching for the handful of scenes that really hit the mark.
This film has stuck with me. Director Denis Villeneuve creates so much tension
with so little. The drive into Juarez and subsequent border crossing scene is
sublime.

#### Firewatch _by Campo Santo_

More of an interactive story than a game, my brother and I played through this
in a single Saturday morning. It made me yearn for the trails, and the voice
acting is spectacular.

#### Mr Robot _by Sam Esmail_

A drama/thriller television series with hacking and security themes that
basically make sense, unlike most other Hollywood treatments.  Combined with
interesting camerawork and soundtrack.

#### Ori and the Blind Forest _by Moon Studios_

A perfect platformer. Easily the most visually stunning game I've ever played.
Every scene is gorgeous, the difficultly progression is appropriately
challenging, controls are tight, and the sound track is superb.
