It's been over two years since I trained for a road race. Between various
injuries and a [trail
diversion](/articles/race-report-north-face-50-mile.html), I haven't run fast
in a very long time.  Late January, after 8 weeks for consistent easy running,
I decided to start training in earnest for a four month run up to Avenue of the
Giants Half Marathon. My goals: complete a training cycle, log a solid race,
don't get injured.

As a bonus, Brent was also trying to do the same thing, so I had a training and
race partner as well. (He posted a [race report](https://brentnowak.net/2018/05/07/race-report-avenue-of-the-giants-half-marathon/) also.)

### Training

I was following the _Half-Marathon Level 1_ plan from Brad Hudson's [_Run
Faster_](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001ANYD3Q/) mostly verbatim, with some days
switched around to better align with [GGRC](http://goldengaterunningclub.org/)
track on Wednesdays. This was a much lower volume plan than the _Level 3_
variant I followed for [my PR](/articles//race-report-walnut-creek-half.html)
(in hindsight more volume than I was ready for, despite the race success),
consistent with my primary goal of avoiding injury. This was a cycle to see if
I could do it, not a cycle to set a new best.

For the most part I handled the volume, though at times I felt like I was only
just holding on. My left leg was tightening up quite severely, though as a
result I was much more diligent about rolling out.

Track workouts all felt easy, and for the most part tempos were comfortable
also. The [two](https://www.strava.com/activities/1456577035/overview) [exceptions](https://www.strava.com/activities/1495036189/overview) were my hardest runs of the year, probably related to
insufficient hydration and/or nutrition.

Long runs are where I need to improve next cycle. I was consistently on the low
end of my target distance, and since many of them were threaded around GGRC
Sunday run, with all the breaks that entails, I don't think I had _any_
continuous run longer than 20K. As a result my aerobic efficiency wasn't where
I wanted it to be, and I ended up hurting in the race as a result.

I had two check-in races that both went very well: an exceedingly comfortable
[sub-20 5K at Napa](https://www.strava.com/activities/1436221460) early in the cycle, and a fantastic <span
data-alt="10mi">16K</span> at the [Guardsmen's Presidio event](https://www.strava.com/activities/1525946687/overview) two weeks
beforehand that I did as an easy tempo. Also nabbed a cheeky [mile PR](https://www.strava.com/activities/1477373729/overview) (5:34)
midway through at the GGRC end-of-quarter time trial.

### Drive and Accommodation

The Avenue of the Giants is about a four hour drive north of San Francisco in
ideal conditions.  Brent and I set out noon Saturday, and after getting stuck
in traffic and stopping for my lunch we only just made it by 5:30, the packet
pick up cut off. Our accommodation was a further hour north, in hindsight a
terrible idea though options were limited. I had only checked Airbnb, but
should have also considered motels. We could have likely found something on the
south side. It would have been further away, but we wouldn't have had to
retrace our steps after the race.

### Course

This [course](https://www.strava.com/activities/1554214051/overview) is widely
regarded as one of the most beautiful around, and for good reason. The entire
length is through towering redwood forest. It's a race worth doing,
particularly since the organization was excellent. That said, allow me a
quibble.

It's an out and back course, but you don't run to anything in particular. The
only defining feature of the turnaround point is that it's half the distance,
marked out in chalk on the road. For me, a big part of forests are the
unexpected reveals: a grove, a valley, a river, a vista. Or at least the
interest and solitude of a trail.

If I'm going to be on road, I think I prefer the "tour of the city" routes such
as [Bend](/articles/race-report-bend-half.html) or [Walnut
Creek](/articles/race-report-walnut-creek-half.html), particularly given the
relative ease of accommodation.

### Race

My watch lied to me. The race organizers had warned that the tree cover would
likely interfere with GPS, but I didn't internalized this warning. I thought we
were running 90 seconds fast before I first reconciled total time to the course
markings at mile 5 and realised we were actually a little slow. For the full
course my watch claims I ran <span data-alt="half a mile">700m</span> further than I actually did.

This made pacing difficult. Also, the undulating course had the effect of
appearing to be downhill even when it wasn't, which was quite disorienting.

We hit the turnaround point at 44:45. Felt comfortable, but a bit slower than
we thought we were running. I started pulling away from Brent at around <span data-alt="mile 9">14K</span>,
figuring that I was picking up the pace slightly and would probably get in
around 1:29. Turns out my effort level increased but my pace did not, though I didn't realise this at the time. My
watch had me slightly fast, and though I was trying to ignore it my race-addled
brain was struggling to reconcile the faulty feedback. I crossed the 10K
turnaround point (i.e. 5K from the finish) only 15s ahead of goal, meaning that
I'd actually returned slower than I headed out.

The last <span data-alt="two miles">3K</span> were a struggle. My legs weren't
too bad, but my heart rate and breathing had gone through the roof. I found
myself wishing I'd been more consistent with my long runs. As per usual I
kicked a little heading into the final stretch, but even then I was slower than
I thought. I had a moment of panic turning into the chute and seeing the clock
ticking over the fifties!

I crossed the line with just five seconds to spare. Official time: 1:29:55.

Though I achieved all my goals, this was a humbling race. I was over confident
going in, and had to work a lot harder than I was expecting to complete it.
This is good. A reminder that running is a long game. No shortcuts. The only
way to get faster is through long periods of consist training. That continual
practice is a big part of why I run in the first place.
