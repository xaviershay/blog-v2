It started a bit slow so I was concerned, but it really kicked off. Wish I'd read this 4 years ago. The guided walkthrough is good but as with clean code would have been better as a screencast. The final chapters on testing are spectacular.

Key takeaways:
- Focus on the communication between objects.
- Ports and adapters architecture to separate the domain.
- Proper division between unit, integration and acceptance tests.
- Use test builders for complex test setup.
- Transactional tests are a hack because you can't do proper unit tests with rails. Commit is important!
