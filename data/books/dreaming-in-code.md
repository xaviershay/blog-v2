Easy read, but this book just frustrated me. I wanted to shout "YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG" throughout the whole thing. It's been half a decade since the events in the book and perhaps we've learned something since then, but I can't stand to watch a project run for 3 years with not much to show. Sure, Rosenberg learns the lessons, giving a diluted history of programming while he's at it, but for a professional programmer they're all old stories. By his own admission he has targeted the book at a wider audience, and as such I didn't find much anything new in it.

And a personal gripe - I really dislike the typical programmer stereotype that this book reinforces.
