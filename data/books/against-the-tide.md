Fantastic leadership biography of Admiral Rickover, the man behind the USA's
nuclear submarine program, written by someone who worked for him. Packed full
of insight.

On culture:

> The downside of culture is that it tends to stifle change and reform. A
> culture is akin to window shades. The lower the shades the less glare from
> the sun inside and the more comfortable it is for the people working in the
> room. However, with the shade down, outside events may pass unseen; certainly
> fewer people inside have the opportunity to recognize that the outside world
> is changing. As culture becomes stronger, it is equivalent to pulling the
> shades even lower. Thus, the very tool that helps people aggressively engage
> in conflict subliminally encourages “a preparation to fight the last war”—the
> most dangerous path for a military force.

On walking the start-up tightrope:

> I have never seen a start-up in which people did not become overenthusiastic.
> As a consequence, those unfamiliar with the details may well believe the
> start-up is more robust, capable, and survivable than it actually is. The
> issue for leaders is how to manage that natural naïveté.

On performance:

> He also understood that fellow workers do not appreciate having a
> nonperformer in their midst. It does not matter whether the person fails
> because he or she is not trying hard enough or is insufficiently talented. If
> the worker can’t perform, the team suffers. Failing to remove a nonperformer
> delivers the denigrating message that the manager does not value the group’s
> work.

On process and innovation:

> By insisting on strict process control for routine evolutions yet
> concurrently encouraging individuals to challenge his system and his
> processes, Rickover was able to institute a scheme in which individuals did
> not have to choose between process and innovation. The nuclear-submarine
> force would value both.
