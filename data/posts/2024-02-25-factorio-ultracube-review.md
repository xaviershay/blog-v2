[Ultracube](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Ultracube) is the most creative
overhaul mod for Factorio I've played yet. You start with a single item: the
cube. You never get another one. This cube is required as a catalyst for
fundamental bulk production of power and material.

This limitation means factories cannot be scaled in the traditional manner. It
all comes down to optimising "cube uptime" in shunting it between operations.

In addition, there are many unique challenges in the later game requiring a
decent amount of circuitry expertise (spoilers below). I found these really fun
but they were certainly more difficult that in any other mod I've tried. This
is a hard mod overall, though short for an overhaul: I completed it in just
under 30 hours.

I _loved_ the theme and flavour text. Joyful, irreverant, but internally
consistent and aided in understanding.

While many (all?) assets were reused from vanilla and [Krastorio
2](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Krastorio2), they were used in very different
ways which made my factory feel even more unique. For example, fabricators
instead of assemblers, red belt from the outset, and the first "basic matter"
material using the plastic icon.

This mod is still under active development. I kept a list of "annoyances" while
playing but virtually all of them have been fixed by the time I write this so
not worth sharing. The main unfixable issue relates to not being able to load
bulk recipes while they still have output: this covered in the FAQ, and can be
worked around adequately with [Inventory
Sensor](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Inventory%20Sensor), which I would
consider a required mod anyway: getting reasonable cube efficiency without it
would be unnecessarily painful. (The documentation for that mod is lacking: you
need to place it with the green/red terminals facing _away_ from the assembler
otherwise it won't work.)

Technologies were not revealed until researching the relevant science card, a
touch I really appreciated. I never knew what was coming next and it was always
a nice surprise. More mods should do this.

I used Alien Biomes but didn't check my map settings and generated a world with
no trees. Wood isn't needed in early game so didn't think anything of it, but
_is_ required to bootstrap something in the mid-game, which was too late to
restart. I console cheated the needed catalyst.

### Mods

In addition to my standard quality-of-life mods, I tried two new mods this run:

* [Wire Shortcuts.](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/WireShortcuts) Circuit wires
  don't need to be crafted. Probably going to use this on all future runs,
  making circuit wires always felt like a chore.
* [Picker Dollies.](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/PickerDollies) Shunt entities
  without picking them up, keeping their wire connections. Invaluable in
  particular for combinators. Adopting for all future runs.
* [Inventory Sensor.](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Inventory%20Sensor)
  Mentioned above, would be pretty niche in other mods but likely useful to
  have.

### Spoilers

Only read this section if you've already played it yourself! This mod really is
a treat to figure out on your own.

* I never really figured out a good way to use the alternative basic matter and
  component recipes unlocked with T3 phantom cubes. Have a nagging feeling I've
  missed something interesting. ([Not just me it seems.](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Ultracube/discussion/65cfc05d372da65e017845f7)
* Seeing my first cube powered train zoom off was a genuine moment of
  unexpected delight.
* Qubit processing was my favourite puzzle. I was afraid it was going to be
  like arcospheres from [Space
  Exploration](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/space-exploration), but it was a
  completely different non-trivial combinator problem with none of the
  frustrations of arcospheres.
* The Cyclotron was confusing, it looks like it is unpowered. It does operate
  how the description text says though (80s delay), and I solved it with a
  timer circuit with I _think_ is the intended solution it just took me a while
  to realise I was supposed to build it myself. Fun little challenge once I
  realised.
* Uranium processing adds a new element but to me it still played exactly the
  same as vanilla so felt a bit like extra complexity for no new challenge.
* The final Ziggurat challenge was tough but ultimately rewarding. I needed a
  few tries to get it right. It's possible to fail hard here, ending in state
  where you can't reconstruct the cube. Would have liked some warning, since I
  don't think that's ever been the case in any other mod. I had to reload a
  couple of times. I was surprised when the victory screen popped up on
  success, but apparently that's changed in recent versions.
* The power generation option unlocked at T6 feels too late: I already had to
  scale up power massively (annoyingly) for the Ziggurat to get there ... and
  I've already been shown a victory screen. (This might be fixed in later
  versions? Not sure.)
* I never got to playing with the Mystery Furnace. Will need to go back in...

I created a [mapshot of the factory for
posterity,](https://mapshot.xaviershay.com/ff/index.html) where you can scroll
and zoom around. This is a fantastic mod that everyone should try.
