Interesting take but too cynical for me. Can't believe it was written in _1993!?_

> ‘The public always had the technology to get involved with the action if it wanted to. Right back to the Greeks. All they had to do was get up on stage and join in. But they didn’t do it, did they? Weird, huh? Maybe, just maybe, they kind of guessed that it would completely screw up the show. The public could always choose their own endings when they read books. All they had to do was get a damn pen and write in that Scrooge never got nice and Moby Dick was a chipmunk. But they didn’t, and why? Because the public don’t pay for entertainment in order to have to provide it themselves
