Old man chews out his son in letters, complete with rambling stories to emphasise points. Short quick read, and if you can excuse the late-1800s casual -isms it's pretty funny and has some good quotes.

 "You’ll find that education’s about the only thing lying around loose in this world, and that it’s about the only thing a fellow can have as much of as he’s willing to haul away. Everything else is screwed down tight and the screw-driver lost."

"Education’s a good deal like eating—a fellow can’t always tell which particular thing did him good, but he can usually tell which one did him harm."

"When I told you that I wished you to get a liberal education, I didn’t mean that I wanted to buy Cambridge."

"I should say, on general principles, that she was a fine girl to let some other fellow marry."

etc etc
