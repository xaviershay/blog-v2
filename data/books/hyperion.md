I don't really know how to rate this. It's a homer car of a book - seven(?) completely separate plot lines, that come together in a way that's totally unexplained in this book though possibly will be in future books. A villain(?) that is similarly unexplained. Heap of weird - and interesting? - ideas. No idea where it's going. Feels unique.

I dunno, I'm going to read the next one so that's something.
