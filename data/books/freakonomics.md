Falls into the "Ripley's believe it or not category" of "wow look at this fascinating thing" which I don't really enjoy much, especially when by the author's own admission there isn't really a unifying theme or point. Picked this up because I needed a book I could read all day while it was raining in Bellingen, which my other book wasn't.
