## Literature

#### All Fours _by Miranda July_

Unhinged. Couldn't put it down. _The First Bad Man_, an earlier novel by the
same author was even wilder.

> At five o’clock I have to consciously dial myself down before reentering the
> house, like astronaut Buzz Aldrin preparing to unload the dishwasher
> immediately after returning from the moon. Don’t talk about the moon, I
> remind myself. Ask everyone how their day was.

#### Western Lane _by Chetna Maroo_

Beautiful short book that says lot with very little. Follows a Gujarati family
after the death of their mother, with protagonist 11 year-old Gopi training for
a squash tournament and being raised by her father.

> It was an awful evening, everyone on edge, and I didn’t know why and maybe no
> one else did either.

#### Saint Sebastian's Abyss

Short satire about two art critics devoting their lives to a single work from
an otherwise unknown painter. Funny and fresh.

#### The Corrections _by Jonathan Franzen_

Incredibly written farce about a midwestern mother trying to get her family
together for one last Christmas. Some brilliant long scenes (the "revenge
dinner" stands out) and pitch-perfect characters.

#### Rejection _by Tony Tulathimutte_

An obsence, disgusting, squirming book that I cannot in good conscience
recommend to anyone but was nevertheless brilliant.

> Here finally Kant perceives the true rift between them: Julian doesn’t know
> the difference between embarrassment and shame. How shame soaks, stains,
> leaves a skidmark on everything and, when it has nothing to stick to, spreads
> until it does. Embarrassment is contained by incidents, gets funny and small
> over time; shame runs gangrene through the entire past, makes the future
> impossible. You can’t own it or laugh it off, only try to bail it out in
> sloshing bucketfuls, drenching yourself in the process. Embarrassment is an
> event, shame a condition, one that Julian has somehow either mastered or
> never experienced, which explains why he’s so easygoing, and why, to him, the
> world is so tractable, why all seems fixable with talk.


## Fantasy

#### The Raven Scholar _by Antonia Hodgson_

Smash two fantasy tropes together and add a fresh take on narrative, you get
this book. Fun plot and dialogue.

#### The Library At Mount Char _by Scott Hawkins_

Everything about this book is weird. I'm not sure it's _fantasy_, but I don't
know what it is. It's tough to orient in and I'm not even sure I want to read
another like it, but it was so thoroughly _different_ that I couldn't put it
down.

## Non-fiction

#### I'm Glad My Mom Died _by Jennette McCurdy_

Completely wild autobiography, consumed it over two days. I didn't know who
this person was. Among other things, speaks frankly about her struggles with
eating disorder.

#### Among The Thugs _by Bill Buford_

An American Journalist embeds himself in Man U's supporter club to explore 
football violence and ends up right in the thick of it. Horrifying but also
insightful, particularly on the nature of crowds.

#### Trick Mirror _by Jia Tolentino_

A lot of my reading this year was recommended by her, so thought I'd read her
own book too. Collectin of essays on internet culture, feminism, religion and
drugs. All strong.

> In the seventies, researchers believed that MDMA treatment would be discrete
> and limited—that once you got the message, as they put it, you could hang up
> the phone. You would be better for having listened. You would be changed.
> They don’t say this about religion, but they should.
