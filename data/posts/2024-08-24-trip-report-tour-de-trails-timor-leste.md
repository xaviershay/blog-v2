### Day 1

<em><span data-alt="7mi (+2,950ft, -2,300ft)">12k (+900m, -700m)</span></em>

A couple of hours in the van to our starting point at Asumanu for a <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/12101286381">half day</a> run to start the tour.

First segment was some incredibly steep single track descent of <span
data-alt="1,600ft">500m</span> down to a river, then back up again. Weather:
hot.

Visited an old encampment of some Australian soldiers from world war II,
and a secret cellar used by the resistance. Camped in tents outside a guest house in Fatubessi.

### Day 2

<em><span data-alt="17mi (+3,000ft, -4,500ft)">27k (+1,000m, -1,500m)</span></em>

Longest day of the trip, and another hot one, from <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/12101286623">Fatubessi to Datu Rua.</a> Long
descent to a wider river fording and a coconut break. Beau subsequently
schooled me on the sharp <span data-alt="2.5mi">4k</span> climb to the finish.
Another night in tents in a local family's backyard.

### Day 3

<em><span data-alt="8mi (+3,700ft, -1,700ft)">13k (+1,100m, -530m)</span></em>

Most runnable day yet from [Data Rua to
Atsabe.](https://www.strava.com/activities/12101286392) Lot more fire trail.
Went to see a waterfall after and spent a few hours there while Chris tried to
recover his crashed drone. Had roadside cup noodles, most excellent. Weather
starting to cool off as we get higher.

### Day 4

<em><span data-alt="16mi (+6,750ft, -4,560ft)">26k (+2,060m, -1,390m)</span></em>

<a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/12101286668">Long climb up Mt Ramelau,</a> the highest point on the island at <span data-alt="9,797ft.">2,986m.</span> Fast and fun descent to a guesthouse for the night. High enough that it actually got cold overnight.

### Day 5

<em><span data-alt="9mi (+1,150ft, 4,000ft)">14k (+350m, -1,230m)</span></em>

Final day running down from <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/12111937843">Hatobulico to Mota Dokomali,</a> via an amazing
waterwall. Lot of dirt road but some cheeky trail shortcuts kept it
interesting.

## Bonus Day

<em><span data-alt="9mi">15k</span></em>

Back in the heat of Dili, got out early to run flat <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/12115137063">along the Dili waterfront</a> to the base of the Christo Rei statue overlooking the bay. It was closed for construction, getting an upgrade in preparation for the Pope's visit later in the year.

### End Note

This was my second trip with [Tour de Trails](https://tourdetrails.com/) and again they delivered on an amazing trip, in conjuction with [Mad Dog Adventures.](https://maddogadventures.com.au/) Thanks Chris and Sam for putting it on. It was a fun, social group, and they managed the logistics, differing paces, and dietaries with aplomb. They run tours in other fun places like the UK, Crete and Bali â€“ if you are even a little bit curious check them out. Highly recommended.
