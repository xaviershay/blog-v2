Fun bit of pop-math.

> In horse-racing and football, long shots tend to be overvalued by naive gamblers, but in real life we tend to undervalue long shots.

> Influencers are difficult to influence. They are influencers because they discriminate before they share online.

> An early adopter without good judgement is just a spammer, and no one wants to follow a spammer.

> Our feeling of universality about maths is a result of its tautological nature, not a deeper truth.

Nice bit of comfirmatory evidence:

> One study, in which, each day after work, UK professionals either played
> Block! Hexa Puzzle, a Tetris-like puzzle game, or used Headspace, a mindfulness
> app, found that players of Block! recovered better from work-related stress.
> Emily Collins, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bath, who carried
> out the study, said afterwards, ‘Mindfulness might be good for relaxation, but
> video games provide psychological detachment. You get these internal rewards and
> a real sense of control.’
