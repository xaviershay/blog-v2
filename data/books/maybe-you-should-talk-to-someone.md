Memoir of a therapist, centered on her own journey through therapy. Funny, more
twists than you'd expect from a memoir, and a lot of insight into the
therapeutic process.

> We can’t have change without loss, which is why so often people say they want change but nonetheless stay exactly the same.

> When my therapist friends hear this part of the story, they immediately diagnose him as “avoidant.” When my nontherapist friends hear it, they immediately diagnose him as “an asshole.”

> While women feel cultural pressure to keep up their physical appearance, men feel that pressure to keep up their emotional appearance. Women tend to confide in friends or family members, but when men tell me how they feel in therapy, I’m almost always the first person they’ve said it to.

> Relationships in life don’t really end, even if you never see the person again.
