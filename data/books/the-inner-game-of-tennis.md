Thought it was going to be "two stars, should have been a blog post". Didn't feel like the concept needed much marinating in - tl;dr be mindful when you play and practice tennis. Maybe more useful if you're not familiar with mindfulness already. Would have liked to see more engagement/references to existing literature and studies.

Final chapter was good though with some thoughts on competition I hadn't considered before.
