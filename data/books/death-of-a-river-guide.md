I dunno this just didn't grab me, surprising after I five-starred Long Road. Maybe just coz I found the narrative gimmick annoying? Maybe I got my fill of Australian lit? Anyway the only time I felt like reading was when I wanted to put myself to sleep.

"They had snobbery as a dog has fleas." <- this was a good sentence that I highlighted.
