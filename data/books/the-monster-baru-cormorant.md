Over cooked. Too much action and sex, not enough accounting. Also was only half a book, didn't really go anywhere and just sets up third book. Which I will read.

**Update 2023:** Re-read in preparation for third book. Similar but different review, didn't mind the action as much but there were too many dream sequences and character backstories went too wide (e.g. all the Ash story interludes).
