Best book I have read this year. Couldn't put it down. I highlighted 95 passages, many for me to dig into further.

Not only does it savage the existing fossil fuel companies in detail, from pollution to human rights abuse, but also hits futurists and billionaire do-gooders. Which is all pretty standard for a book on climate change, though did cover some new areas for me: abuses of the ETS, under-reported adverse impact of oil spills on young animal populations that are screwing them over years later, big green dealmaking. The standout though is the second half, covering all the successes of movements around the world in actually fighting back. Inspiring, and gives me hope.

*Even if* the world wasn't warming, the community costs and environmental destruction caused by fossil fuel extraction is unacceptable.

Read it.
