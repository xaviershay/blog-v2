Man wins international motorbike races with increasingly absurd handicaps: broken wrist, recently broken neck, busted gear. Emblematic paragraph:

> Because it was a marathon we had no access to spare parts between stages, so
> I gave him my straight rear disc and used his bent one the next day. It
> wasnâ€™t ideal but I was still able to take the stage win.

Toby Price is an animal. Ridiculous autobiography.
