There's a lot of "explaining what the characters are thinking" which shouldn't work ... but 100% does in this context. It's deliberately used as way of fleshing out characters and adding layers of intrigue. Fascinating.

> “I was thinking we’ll all be out of here soon and likely never see the place again.” “Does that make you sad?” “Sad? Nonsense! Parting with friends is a sadness. A place is only a place.”
