An earnest book about space. Rare for me, but I actually enjoyed the slower pacing. Having misread the title as "seven eyes" I really had no idea what was going to happen, so that was neat. Could have stopped reading after first 2 (of 3) chapters. The last one was fine but could easily have been a separate book.

But really it gets five stars because it ignited my curiosity. I've already devoured Fundamentals Of Astrodynamics and am totally getting into Kerbal Space Program.
