Jodie and I met up with two friends who were excited to try a new game they'd bought, "Punderdome", which basically required you to come up with themed puns. We failed utterly at the game, even after cheating, and were led to speculate that in theory there must exist a group of people for which this game would be a) doable, and b) fun, but we certainly didn't know any.

Well, I found them.
