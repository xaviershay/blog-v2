Put off reading for a while because didn't think I'd find it interesting. Incredibly wrong, this was fascinating. Particularly found value in the extremely straightforward dismantling of eugenics and associated philosophies.

> Most Eugenists are Euphemists. I mean merely that short words startle them, while long words soothe them. And they are utterly incapable of translating the one into the other. … Say to them “The … citizen should … make sure that the burden of longevity in the previous generations does not become disproportionate and intolerable, especially to the females”; say this to them and they sway slightly to and fro. … Say to them “Murder your mother,” and they sit up quite suddenly. —G. K. Chesterton, Eugenics and Other Evils


> for the most part, the genetic diversity within any racial group dominates the diversity between racial groups—not marginally, but by an enormous amount. This degree of intraracial variability makes “race” a poor surrogate for nearly any feature: in a genetic sense, an African man from Nigeria is so “different” from another man from Namibia that it makes little sense to lump them into the same category.
