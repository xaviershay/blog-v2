Good story, page turning. Good insight on training, humanitarianism, war.

"I had—before boxing—never been someone who prayed on a daily basis, and it felt uncomfortable at first. But boxing is a violent discipline, and after a few days of getting cracked in the ribs, praying seemed like a sensible way to begin."

"There were a number of definitions of courage, but now I was seeing it in its simplest form: you do what has to be done day after day, and you never quit."

"Of course a man should fight for victims, but if he ceases caring for anything outside that, what's the use of his fighting?"

There was also a great paragraph about acceptance w/r/t street kids in Bosnia that made me think but I neglected to highlight it.
