- Strategies for curtailing information intake were pretty introductory, but maybe useful if you're a total beginner. (It's not that hard a problem, at any rate.)
- Comparisons of information to food were interesting without being overwraught. The coined term "infovegan" conveys an ethical element, which is interesting.
- Call to arms at the end of the book is inspiring, re achievable ways to perform your "civic duty" and engage with society.
- Excellent chapter on transparency: "Clinging to transparency as a replacement for integrity is a bad idea."

Was sitting on four stars, Just nudged up to five by its briefness and inspiring conclusion.
