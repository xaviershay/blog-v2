I read thirty six books last year. Top picks are below, and you can find the
full list [over at the index](/books/#list-2024).

## Literature

It was a good year for literature. All four of these are incredibly well
written and fresh.

#### Yiddish Policemen's Union _by Michael Chabon_

Detective Noir set in a fictional Jewish settlement in Alaska. Loved the
Yiddish peppered throughout.

> Nine months Landsman’s been flopping at the Hotel Zamenhof without any of his
> fellow residents managing to get themselves murdered. Now somebody has put a
> bullet in the brain of the occupant of 208, a yid who was calling himself
> Emanuel Lasker.

#### A Visit From The Goon Squad _by Jennifer Egan_

Each chapter told by a different character in a unique style, and could almost
stand alone as short stories though are still intricately connected. Super
interesting structure.  Its sequel (or ... companion piece?)  _The Candy House_
is also fantastic, focusing more on near-future technology.

> “Time’s a goon, right? You gonna let that goon push you around?” Scotty shook
> his head. “The goon won.”

#### The Office Of Historical Corrections _by Danielle Evans_

Six short stories and a novella that all feel unique.

> I used to think you were so brave, and sometimes I still do, and sometimes I
> think it’s just that there’s nothing in your life but you, and you have no
> idea what it means to be scared that what you do might matter.

#### Writers & Lovers _by Lily King_

Witty and poignant. Recommended
[here](https://www.tiktok.com/@newlynova/video/7351464173840256286) as "read
this if you're looking to get into literary fiction" which is spot on.  I
discovered this creator this year and many of her recommendations were
fantastic.

> Fitzgerald said that the sign of genius is being able to hold two
> contradictory ideas in your head at the same time. But what if you hold two
> contradictory fears? Are you still some kind of a genius?

## Non-fiction

#### The Price of Peace _by Zachary D. Carter_

Biography of John Maynard Keynes, who I previously only knew nothing of except
the economic school of thought he is famously known for. Usually not into
biographies but this was good.

Made me appreciate how his thought was shaped by real world experience: across
both world wars, involvement in the arts, and a deep-seated desire to create
the conditions for peace — of which economics plays a critical role.

Also gave me a new lens into international relations around that time.

#### Maybe You Should Talk To Someone _by Lori Gottlieb_

Memoir of a therapist, centred on her own journey through therapy. Funny, more
twists than you’d expect from a memoir, and a lot of insight into the
therapeutic process.

#### Outlive _by Peter Attia_

What do you want to be able to do at eighty? Figure that out then work
backwards. You probably need to be a _lot_ stronger today to account for
inevitable physical decline.

Wasn't simply about "do exercise" though. What types of exercise? Why? Also
covers nutrition, drugs, and mental health from an evidence informed
perspective.

> It’s important, obviously, that our strategy be based on evidence.
> Unfortunately, the pursuit of longevity is where the most powerful tool of
> Medicine 2.0, the randomised clinical trial in humans, runs into a brick
> wall. Randomised controlled trials are used to determine cause and effect in
> relatively simple, short-term situations. It’s fairly easy, for example, to
> run a study showing that sunscreen prevents sunburn. But such studies are of
> limited use in our quest for longevity.

> People get old when they stop thinking about the future.

#### Against The Tide _by David T. Oliver_

Best management book I've read in a while, even though it's ostensibly a
biography. Admiral Rickover was the man behind the USA's nuclear submarine
program. Packed with insight, particular as it relates to managing both process
compliance and innovation at the same time.

> By insisting on strict process control for routine evaluations yet
> concurrently encouraging individuals to challenge his system and his
> processes, Rickover was able to institute a scheme in which individuals did
> not have to choose between process and innovation. The nuclear-submarine
> force would value both.


## Fantasy & Sci-Fi

#### The Mountain In The Sea _by Ray Nayler_

Near future AI and climate sci-fi. Also there is an octopus. Great
themes.

#### Piranesi _by Susanna Clarke_

Weirdly unique. A good paced short read.

#### Light Bringer _by Pierce Brown_

Book six of the Red Rising saga. Was losing interest in the series after its
initially strong start, but this book turned it around. Great mix of action and
plot.

#### Artificial Wisdom _by Thomas R. Weaver_

Another near future AI/climate sci-fi. Very different to previous
recommendation: much more action heavy and not as well written but still
worthwhile for the themes.
