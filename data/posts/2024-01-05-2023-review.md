Every year I review my habits, exercise, and projects for the previous year.

## Daily Habits

* **Read (part of) a book.** Finished fifty-two of them in total. Wrote up my [top picks for the year.](/articles/2023-reading-list.html)
* **[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) cards.** Another year of the same geography and element cards. This is maybe three cards a day.
* **Gratitude journal.** I record both things I did well, and things that brought me joy.
* **Prehab.** Bare minimum stretching and exercises for my back.

In addition I also tracked the following but didn't commit to any frequency:

* **Set of pull-ups.** Ended up being mostly daily, with occasional rest days. Started the year at set of three, increasing to eight currently.
* **Set of push-ups.** Same frequency as pull-ups. Usually 15-25.
* **Alcohol-free day.** I drank about once a month for the first half of the year, once a week for the back half and a bit less than every other day for December (mostly courtesy of [Carwyn Cellars Canvent...](https://carwyncellars.com.au/products/carwyn-canvent-2023)).

This coming year is going to look fairly similar I think, I'm not feeling the
need to change much.

I use and recommend [Loop Habit Tracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.isoron.uhabits&hl=en_SG) and [Gratitudes Journal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bailouni.gratitudes&hl=en_SG) to keep track of things.

## Sport

### Running

Despite some minor setbacks and very little racing, It was a great year for
running. I continued my focus on longer trail events, with a really solid training block to start the year. This lead to a [PR for
50k](https://www.strava.com/activities/8693546298) at Warburton Trail Fest in
March on the way to [3rd place in the multi-day event.](https://tomatotiming.racetecresults.com/results.aspx?CId=16&RId=29421&EId=11)
Three weeks later I ran [my first 100K](https://www.strava.com/activities/8812330177) as part of the Buffalo Stampede Ultra
Grand Slam multi-day event. It felt strong, though following it up with a 42K
the day after was too much and I needed six weeks of virtually no running
afterwards to rehab my right knee. That was followed by a month of base
building before two massive social trips: first to [Hawaii to backpack the NƒÅ
Pali coast,](/articles/trip-report-na-pali-coast.html) then a running tour through the [alps from Switzerland to France.](/articles/trip-report-tour-de-trails-france.html)

Was feeling strong coming home, but fell sick three times over the next few
months before discovering (and having removed) an infected tooth, all of which
took at least a week each out of training.

As a result I bailed on both Hume & Hovell 50K and Surf Coast 100K, but I did
manage to be healthy enough for a decent crack at 4peaks at the start of
November.

December was a solid month, including double workout weeks with 40k+ long runs
in the back half. I brought in the New Year with Jodie on a [hiking trip in
Tasmania.](/articles/trip-report-tasmania.html)

For the whole year I traversed 3,050K, my most ever, while climbing nearly 80K,
fully double my previous max. Hopefully I can keep momentum into Hut2Hut 100K
mid-February.

I often ran with Hunter Athletics Tuesday mornings around Olympic Park, Studley
Park Run Club around the Yarra trail Thursday evenings, and Dandenong Trail
Runners on Sunday. I continued to be coached by Tim from the [Distance
Collective.](https://www.thedistancecollective.com/)

### Other

I restarted my bouldering gym membership in July but never got a consistent
schedule going. I'm not intending to train this but hope to keep going socially
this year.

I nearly cemented a twice-a-week strength habit going to support my running,
but it was tough to keep restarting bigger lifts every time I got sick. Did a
little bit better with easier prehab work, but in general want to try and do
better here in 2024. That said, I've never previously been able to make
_anything_ stick alongside running, so I'm still happy with a partial success
this year.

We got a table tennis table at work, and a few of us went along to a group
training at MSAC a couple of times. I really enjoyed this but I'm not going to
make time for it in addition to everything else.

I did a handful of introductory BJJ classes just so I could know what everyone
else was talking about. Again, not going to make time for another sport
properly though.

## Projects

* Created a
  [solver](https://github.com/xaviershay/sandbox/tree/main/potionomics) for
  [Potionomics recipes](https://potionomics.com/), and gave a lightning talk
  about it.
* Created [sternbot](https://github.com/ferocia/sternbot), a scraper for Stern
  Insider to create a slack leaderboard and achievements tracker for our
  Godzilla pinball machine at work. (Achieved a 1B+ score on the machine as
  well.)
* Added a [running section](/articles/new-blog-feature-running.html) to this
  site.

### Games

* Completed [Exotic
  Industries](/articles/factorio-exotic-industries-review.html), [Freight
  Forwarding](/articles/factorio-freight-forwarding-review.html), and
  [Krastorio 2](/articles/factorio-krastorio-2-review.html) modpacks for
  Factorio and wrote up reviews for each.
* Enjoyed a full run of [Midnight Suns,](/articles/midnight-suns-review.html) a
  brilliant tactics game trapped in a AAA shell.
* Played a lot of Legends of Runeterra PvE, a AAA deck builder.
* After trying and failing to get into Diablo IV, levelled a
  [Demolitionist/Inquisitor](https://www.grimtools.com/calc/nZogJJBZ) in Grim
  Dawn instead to finish Ultimate difficultly for the first time.

Upgraded graphics card to a from an NVIDIA GTX 1070 to a 4070ti primarily for
Age of Wonders 4, which I ended up not playing much. I also enjoyed Potionomics
and Per Aspera.

Jodie and I got into crosswords this year. Mostly from
[NYT,](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords) with a sprinkling of [Washington
Post.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/crossword-puzzles/daily/) In the last few
months [Saturday Quiz Time](https://www.saturdayquiztime.com.au/) started
publishing a weekly US-style crossword with Australian clues, which has been
really fun. This year I want to start trying NYT Thursday & Friday puzzles more
consistently.

### Music

Gave up trombone in May. With my back fixed, all my primary hobbies came back
and I was no longer making time for it. I didn't play piano much, but learned a
few easy things: _Isn't She Lovely_, _Hymn to Freedom_, and the victory jingle
from when you finish a NYT crossword.

### Miscellaneous

I saw a few shows:

* [Plini, supported by Protest The Hero.](https://www.moshtix.com.au/v2/event/plini-summer-2023-australian-tour/145441) I don't really go to live music anymore, but I couldn't pass up opportunity to see two of my favourite bands live.
* [_Don Quixote_](https://australianballet.com.au/performances/don-quixote) by the Australian Ballet.
* [_I Shall Have A Good Think When Everyone Goes Home_](https://www.malthousetheatre.com.au/what-s-on/past-events/comedy-fest-2023/daniel-kitson/), a stand up set from Daniel Kitson.
* [Banff Mountain film festival](https://banffaustralia.com.au/)
* [Candle light ballet](https://www.invictusquartet.com/upcoming-events/h8z8fj6r6n5nkdt33a6cgtt7kyxg8n) at Collingwood Town Hall.
* [_& Juliet_,](https://andjuliet.com.au/) a really fun musical.
* [MSO performing Rachmaninov and Shostakovich,](https://www.mso.com.au/performance/2023-rachmaninovs-rhapsody) two of my favourite composers.
* [_Constellations_,](https://fortyfivedownstairs.com/event/constellations/) and excellent play with repeating scenes done in different ways. Creative and memorable.


I spoke on panels at [Southstart](https://www.southstart.co/) in Adelaide and [Intersekt](https://www.intersektfestival.com/) in Melbourne, and attended [SXSW](https://sxswsydney.com/) in Sydney.

I fasted for a day of Ramadan.

I grew a beard.
