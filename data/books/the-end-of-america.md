Scathing and crystal clear critique of the Bush Administration, at the time this book was written having been in power for 6 years. Wolf draws parallels between dictatorships of the past (Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, Latin American Dictators) and activities that are happening now in America. Of note, the observation that for most people a "facist shift" still looks like normal - the papers keep publishing, lawyers keep practicing, entertainers keep performing. Excellent.
