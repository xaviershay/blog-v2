I read fifty two books this year, slightly above average and with a solid hit
rate of four and five star books.

Top picks are below, and you can find the full list [over at the
index](/books/#list-2023). If you only read one, make it _Anxious People._

## Non-Fiction

#### Invisible Women _by Caroline Criado Perez_

A trove of research across multiple domains comprehensively documenting the
“data gap” when it comes to women, and the harm that causes. Much supported
intutitions I already had (e.g. use of “generic masculine” isn’t neutral,
discrepancy in performance reviews), but many new insights as well (e.g.
snow-clearing streets “pedestrian-first”, a need that is often hidden in
transport studies, reduces overall injury rates, the impact of various quota
systems in political representation.) A big takeaway for me was the importance
of sex-disaggregating data.

#### The Wife Drought _by Annabelle Crabb_

A look at the data and drivers of under-representation of women in the
workplace ... and of men at home. I hadn't thought much about "glass
fire-escapes" – social pressures and norms making it hard for men to leave the
workforce.

#### How We Love _by Clementine Ford_

Beautiful read, raw and honest.

> But one of the many lessons I’m learning as a mother is how to accept that my
> love cannot be an anchor that drags him beneath the waves. Rather, it must be
> the deep water itself, buoyant and clear, for him to float in, to swim
> through, to carry him in its currents to shore when it is time for him to
> leave it as he surely one day will, as he surely one day must.

#### Noise _by Daniel Kahneman_

Important reading if you manage in an industry that routinely applies
judgement. Reducing noise can be just as effective at improving decision
quality as reducing bias: they affect the math in the same way, and noise is
often a larger contributor and easier to address.

I wrote a more [detailed summary.](/books/noise.html)

#### Good For A Girl _by Lauren Fleshman_

The perfect autobiography. Addresses important issues facing women in sport,
uses her story to illustrate data and research, addresses her own history
plainly. [More detailed review
here.](http://localhost:4001/books/good-for-a-girl.html)

> I ignored my loneliness and called it independence.


## Fiction

#### Anxious People _by Fredrik Backman_

Only book to ever make me both laugh out loud but also cry. Kept going where I
didn't expect.

> Because everyone loves someone, and anyone who loves someone has had those
> desperate nights where we lie awake trying to figure out how we can afford to
> carry on being human beings. Sometimes that makes us do things that seem
> ridiculous in hindsight, but which felt like the only way out at the time.

Honorable mention to _Beartown_ by the same author, which has a similar style
and is also excellent.

#### The Heart's Invisible Furies _by John Boyne_

Story of an adoptee growing up (and then old) gay in Ireland. Tragic at times,
hilarious throughout.

#### Heat 2 _by Michael Mann_

A straight continuation of the original movie _Heat_, which you definitely need
to have watched before reading. Great scenes and tension.

## Sci-fi

#### Exhalation _by Ted Chiang_

A unique short story collection. Surprising and thoughtful.

#### The Collapsing Empire Trilogy _by John Scalzi_

Was turned off Scalzi a while ago so was reluctant to pick this up, but I'm
glad I did. I really enjoy political/economic sci-fi and this delivers, with a
surprising and satisfying conclusion.

> Confidence isn’t about knowing you’re right. Confidence is about knowing you
> can make it right.

#### Valuable Humans In Transit _by qntm_

A new release since I read his back-catalog in 2022. Fantastic collection of
short stories, very distinctive. Particularly enjoyed _Frame by Frame_.
