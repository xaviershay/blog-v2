Big changes this year! After eight years in San Francisco we moved back to Melbourne in March. This was always the long term plan, and we finally made it happen. We also bought our first home, in Fitzroy, and are loving both it and the neighbourhood.

## Work

After a year of part-time consulting, I was ready to dive back into full-time
work. I spoke to a number of companies in Melbourne for many types of roles but
ultimately decided to take a non-management job at
[Ferocia](https://www.ferocia.com.au/) building [Up](https://up.com.au/), a new
digital bank. Ferocia was the combination of two previous teams I loved
working with ([Clear Grain](https://www.cleargrain.com.au/), [The
Conversation](http://theconversation.com/au)) and I was excited to build
something cool with them again.

I really enjoyed writing code full time again, in particular learning first
hand how much JavaScript has changed in the last decade. I had the opportunity
to [learn more about emoji](https://up.com.au/blog/where-do-emoji-come-from/)
than was probably good for me, and get down into the [guts of
Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/36795) for the first time in a long
while.

Perhaps inevitably I ended up drifting away from code though. Over the
last few months I have been running point on our [TransferWise
integration](https://up.com.au/blog/up-integrates-with-transferwise/), helping
out with support, and working with the leadership team on more general
management as our team continues to grow. So I think that tells us where my
heart lies!


## Habits

I kept the same three daily habits from [last year]({{ site.baseurl }}/articles/2018-review.html):

* Read a book (see my [reading list for the year]({{ site.baseurl }}/articles/2019-reading-list.html)).
* 60-70s plank.
* 25-30 push-ups.

Since November I've re-introduced meditation. I was doing this un-guided,
but for the last week have been working through the [Waking Up
course](https://wakingup.com/) and finding it valuable: I feel like the change
is leading to better sessions and more lasting impact through out the day.

## Travel

I deliberately avoided much travel this year. After everything I got up to
last year, I wanted to re-engage with Melbourne and work. That said,
I've enjoyed seeing a bit more of Victoria and in particular have spent a bit
of time down the coast (helps that family is down there also).

## Running

It was a good but different year for running. Total volume was solid (~2500K)
but only two races: an equal 5K time trial PB in March (18:16) and my second
fastest half in April (1:26:47). (I never wrote a race report for that: went
out too fast, died spectacularly. If I was chasing 1:26 instead of 1:25 likely
would have PBed.) Leading up to the half I worked with a coach, [TJ from
RunDoyen](https://www.rundoyen.com/running-coaches/tj-garlatz/). I really
valued that experience. He helped find sensible ways to increase my workload,
adapted my plan as needed (for either life or fatigue), and in general was a
great partner in my training. One downside was that, though he lined up similar
workouts I was "doing my own thing" from my running group.  This was OK in San
Francisco since I was already well entwined in my club, but moving back to
Australia I felt it would hinder me finding my scene here which is why I
decided to move off a plan after April.

I was under the weather heading into June so had a few down weeks (including my
only full zero for the year). Was also struggling with motivation in general
over winter. Always have a plan going into winter, because you'll never start
one!  Through July to September I took advantage of our gym and coach at work
and experimented with incorporating lifting into my training. I figure this is
probably better for my long term health than simply running all the time. In
practice this meant easy run Saturday, long run Sunday, then bench, deads, and
accessories during the week.

![Year in running]({{site.baseurl}}/images/strava-2019.png)

But I like running too much! In October I started running consistently Tuesday
and Thursday mornings with [Hunter
Athletics](https://runningcrews.com/crews/hunter-athletics-recreation/).
Strength training faded away, and after a two month build (30-50K weeks) by
December I was up to 5.5 days and 70K a week.

One goal for this year was to incorporate data from an [Oura
ring](https://ouraring.com/) into my training. It was a fun experiment. I was
impressed that it could tell me when I didn't have enough sleep or when I was
sick ... but I already knew that. I didn't learn anything that I could feed back
into my training. Either I'm consistent enough in my sleeping and recovery
routines, not training hard enough to warrant it, or insufficiently sensistive
to the data. I'm still wearing the ring: am used to it now, and perhaps the
longitudal data will be interesting.

## Projects

### Music

I don't have many life goals, but having a real piano was one of them. With the
space in the new house, I went overboard and acquired a beautiful Yamaha grand.
That kicked off a foray back into music:

* Recorded three [solo piano
  pieces](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLo0MeSg32W3fnAo7j0UsIgv_CZEsUm4ut).
  As much as anything this was an excuse to figure out _how_ to record them,
  both video and audio.
* Learned about software modular synthesis using [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/).
  Made some [screencast
  tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLo0MeSg32W3dc2balbKfHEAKSYducabO9),
  a [creepy ambient
  patch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPI8XgzFPFU&list=PLo0MeSg32W3dc2balbKfHEAKSYducabO9&index=4&t=0s),
  and a [stupid randomized version of
  _Deantown_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUNJJJFx_XM&list=PLo0MeSg32W3dc2balbKfHEAKSYducabO9&index=5&t=0s).
* Played around with some hardware synthesizers and sequencers. Did a couple of
  jam sessions with [Pete](http://notahat.com/). Covered [You Can Call Me
  Al](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8viNR-fUNq4) while learning how to use
  the Digitakt, which was fun.

### Programming

I did intend to stream more this year, but by the time I'd moved back and got
my office set up again I wasn't feeling it.

* Last year I made a proof assistant for _Magic: The Gathering_. This year, I
  used it to verify a new paper showing that [MTG is turing
  complete](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09828) (finding a bug in the
  paper!), and then spent an unreasonable amount of time to actually run a
  computation on it. This involved reading a lot of papers, some [more Ruby
  code](https://github.com/xaviershay/turing-toys), and culminated in the most
  fun talk I've given: [Tiny Turing Toys: Tapes, States and
  Breaks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJ5oQ6bya-I&t=525s). This project
  rekindled my sense of awe. I was shocked and inspired at how many layers of
  abstraction and discoveries needed to be made over decades to make all of
  this possible.
* Learned TLA+ and used it to specify a [simplistic multi-datacenter payments
  processing
  model](https://github.com/xaviershay/tla-sandbox/blob/master/payments.tla).
  Didn't manage to use in anger at work though. Had one problem that felt like
  I should have been able to but couldn't quite "see" it. Wrote some simplified models
  in Ruby instead, so was able to apply some lessons learned even outside of
  the TLA+ environment. [Hillel Wayne](https://www.hillelwayne.com/) has been on a
  tear this year talking about, training in, and popularizing TLA+. I found his
  book [Practical TLA+](https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484238288) most
  helpful!
* Started a [Haskell implementation of
  Hanabi](https://github.com/xaviershay/hanabi), which gave me an opportunity
  to try using [freer effects in
  practice](https://github.com/xaviershay/hanabi/pull/4) instead of the MTL
  stack I usually reach for. [Freer Monads, More Better
  Programs](https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/freer-monads/) was what
  inspired me to finally give them a go.
* In the same Hanabi project, also experimented with using D3 as a full game
  rendering engine and was impressed with the results. Also led to some neat
  experiments with 3D CSS:

  ![Hanabi]({{site.baseurl}}/images/hanabi.gif)

* Made a simple [aural interval
  trainer](https://github.com/xaviershay/bluetune) for Android to better learn
  React Native.
* Finally put together an index of the [sheet
  music](https://sheets.xaviershay.com/) I've made over the last decade.
* Designed and programmed [two VCV Rack
  modules](https://github.com/xaviershay/vitamin-vcv-modules): polyphonic
  panning and an effect bypass. Unfortunately one of them still has a crash bug
  I haven't been able to track down üôÅ
* Experimented with some home automation using OpenHAB and HomeAssistant, but
  ultimately caved and am using proprietary apps instead.

### Games

There were a few standout gaming experiences this year.  Retroactively, it
appears my theme was "learn why other people like things I don't" ... and
then end up liking them myself!

First the computer ones:

* **Starcraft 2.** Full campaign was fun, but the main event was getting to platinum
  with Zerg in 1v1 online. Gave me a lot more appreciation for pro level play.
* **DOTA 2.** I didn't play that much, but I learned how the game
  worked where previously I simply didn't understand how anyone could be into
  it. It's extremely deep strategically. Really enjoyed playing with
  friends, not so much with randoms.
* **Endless Space 2.** Thought I was done with 4X games but fell into this one for
  about 70 hours --- three Endless difficulty play throughs with
  Lumeris/Conquest, Unfallen/Science, and Riftborn/Wonder. Really well
  polished, each race felt very different to play in the early game. Still a
  lot more content to explore if I go back to it.
* **SteamWorld Quest.** A late entrant I picked up in Christmas sales. Enjoyable
  combination of deck building and Final Fantasy style combat. Started right
  back in with a second run after finishing.

More physically:

* **Pinball.** I've never played before, nor been inclined to, but we have
  _Demolition Man_ at work so I thought it a good opportunity to figure out what's
  going on. Currently hold the #3 and #4 scores. Also had the chance to sample
  a heap of tables at PAX, where we had a stall for Up.
* **Logic Puzzles.** Again not a thing I've historically been interested in, but a
  recommendation for [Cracking the Cryptic](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC-UOdK8-mIjxBQm_ot1T-Q) YouTube channel got me curious.
  Their very British enthusiasm is infectious. In particular I've enjoyed
  non-standard Sudokus, and Grandmaster Puzzles' [The Art of
  Puzzles](https://gmpuzzles.com/store/the-art-of-puzzles) series, which I had
  printed and bound at a local shop.

## 2020

Who knows? Still feel like I've just moved back. There are many exciting things
coming up at work that will keep me engaged.

With running I probably should pick a target race, but I've been enjoying
training without a goal over summer. Important that I pick something for spring
to get me through winter. Maybe this is the year of the marathon!?
