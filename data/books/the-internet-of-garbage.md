Good short read about (anti-)harassment on the internet, parallels with spam, relation to law, and policy/feature suggestions.

"Any anti-harassment strategy that focuses on deletion and removal is doomed to spin in circles, damned to the Sisyphean task of stamping out infinitely replicable information."

"When free speech forms the foundation of democracy, free speech is more than a libertarian value. It indicates a more complex, difficult obligation: the obligation to create a space for everyone. It means a space where participants arenâ€™t silenced by fear, or shouted down."
