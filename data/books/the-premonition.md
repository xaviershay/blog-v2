Pretty standard Lewis book. Good characters, relevant story.

> At last count the United States, with a bit more than 4 percent of the world’s population, had a bit more than 20 percent of its COVID-19 deaths.

> He encouraged his children to tackle problems with the same confidence that he shaped steel. “If some other dumb fuck can do it, so can you,”

> One measure of poverty is how little you have. Another is how difficult you find it to take advantage of what others try to give you.
