Required reading. Picks up where "Predictably Irrational" left off. Plenty of examples demonstrating how fallible my own brain is (even more than I thought). Regression to the mean, the horrible performance of expert prediction (how does this reflect on our interview process?), and much more. Also introduced me to the idea of "paternalistic libertarianism" and the book "Nudge", which at first glance seems to warrant attention.
