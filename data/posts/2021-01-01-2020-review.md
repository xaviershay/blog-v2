What a year. In addition to the severe Melbourne lockdowns keeping me indoors
and working from home, I crashed my bike mid-September fracturing my left wrist
and right arm, taking me out of action for nearly two months. Grateful that I
was able to get _anything_ done this year.

## Daily Habits

* Read a book (see my [reading list for the year]({{ site.baseurl }}/articles/2020-reading-list.html)).
* 60-70s plank.
* 25-30 push-ups.
* 10min meditation

Everything except reading came apart after my accident. I still can't put
enough weight on my wrist to do push-ups. For plank and meditation I've just been
lazy. For this year I'm dropping daily meditation, but we have a group session
at work in the mornings where I'll continue to practice. Will work back up to
the plank and push-ups.

## Running

Solid year despite some setbacks and not being able to run with other people
for most of it. Logged 2800K all up, an increase of 400K over the past two
years and equal with 2015 for most ever.

![Weekly mileage for the year]({{site.baseurl}}/images/running-2020.png)

Started strong with an accidental [21K PR
(1:25:39)](https://www.strava.com/activities/3123439682) at the Sri Chimnoy
event in February with what was supposed to be a training run. Set out at
marathon pace after an 8K(!) warmup but two laps in was feeling good and
flicked on the afterburners for the final lap.

Kept training strong after that, but burned out at the start of April two weeks
into lockdown. Decided to wrap up the season with a [5K time trial and nabbed another PR
(18:01)](https://www.strava.com/activities/3260978622). Dropped back to about
three runs a week, but none of my long runs hit 20K and I was under 50K a week
for all of the second quarter.

Started pulling out of my slump late June and after four weeks of base building
started Pfitzinger's 16 week marathon plan on July 20. I managed to find a
treadmill despite the shortage and completed most of my training on that, which
was a new experience.

<p/>

Was getting to the business end of the plan when I crashed my bike
mid-September, which aside from a couple of test runs took me out completely
for 6 weeks. Sat on around 50-60K for the six weeks after that to get back
into it. Not a lot of workouts but starting to look like I hadn't lost as much
fitness as I feared.

In December I was feeling strong and got around a lot of
trails. Ran a [50K loop around Wilson's Promontory](https://www.strava.com/activities/4440495118) with Dad
which was a highlight for the year. HNTR Tuesday workouts started back
up the next week. Extremely solid [sub-40 Michigan
workout](https://www.strava.com/activities/4513807899) on Christmas day, [30K
in the Macedon Ranges](https://www.strava.com/activities/4522410843) two days
after, then topped off the year with a [Tan PR
(14:40)](https://www.strava.com/activities/4531091278) and a solo loop of the
[Surf Coast 50K route.](https://www.strava.com/activities/4537182665) Extremely
solid month.

Best of all: no overuse injuries! Shoe-wise, have gone through many, many pairs
of Brooks Levitate 2 for normal runs. Now that they are two models out of date
they are quite cheap! Saucony Peregrine 8 for trails, and a pair of Nike
Vaporfly for races and the odd workout. The Peregrine's were my second choice
after not being able to find any Salomon Sense Pro in stock, but they've been
really good --- comfortable, light, zero blisters. In particular have been
surprised at the recovery benefits of the Vaporflys, so am looking to
transition to a similar shoe (maybe the Nike Tempo or Brooks Hyperion Tempo?)
for more of my training, which I expect will continue to help with keeping
injury at bay.

Feeling really good about the year to come!

## Projects

### Music

* Completed â…” of [Andrew Huang's Music Production
  course](https://monthly.com/andrew-huang-music) --- went back to work and didn't
  have the energy for the final third --- resulting in a completed piece
  [_Renew._](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4rZr6Cml0w)
* Published more than [20 vlogs and
  recordings](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8-DvIU3okeUS44vrGDNUPg)
  tracking my continued experiments with synthesis, including a few new
  additions on the hardware front. I'm most excited about the Digitone and the
  Peak.
* Wrote up the [voicings I typically use for Chameleon.](https://sheets.xaviershay.com/)
* Did a [comparative analysis of different performances of Chopin's Grand Valse Brillante](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6vqCi178yo).
* Played piano most days when I was able, but not a huge amount of actual
  practice. Had a few new pieces just about ready to record before my accident,
  haven't put the work in to get them back up to scratch yet.

</center>

### Programming

* Got about 90% of the way on [Factorio Layout
  Designer.](https://github.com/xaviershay/factorio-layout-designer) Integrated
  with [Factorio Item Browser](https://www.factorio-item-browser.com/) API to
  enable planning of factories using any custom combination of mods. Inspired
  by wanting to better optimize my Krastorio 2 factory. Worked in dev but never
  quite got around to polishing it enough to release.
* Finally [fixed the crash
  bug](https://github.com/xaviershay/vitamin-vcv-modules/issues/1#issuecomment-646888507)
  in my VCV Rack modules. Lesson learned: use extreme caution when writing C!
* [Re-did the effects system in
  Dovin](https://github.com/xaviershay/dovin/pull/2) (a MTG puzzle proof
  assistant), it now more closely implements the layer system for continuous
  effects per the official rules. This was particularly tricky to find a
  solution I liked. I tried a number of approaches throughout the year and only
  just landed on something I feel is going to be sufficiently workable.

### Miscellaneous

* Delivered a well-received keynote at Rubyconf in February [_My Experience With
  Experience._](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0na_1A_-Ebo)
* Spoke to the [Select Committee on Financial Technology and Regulatory
  Technology](https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;db=COMMITTEES;id=committees%2Fcommsen%2Faeb4dd20-c72d-46fd-9981-906bea37a2f7%2F0004;query=Id%3A%22committees%2Fcommsen%2Faeb4dd20-c72d-46fd-9981-906bea37a2f7%2F0000%22) on behalf of Ferocia, my first government engagement.
* Published [_Short Mantras to Interrupt Imposter
  Syndrome_](/articles/short-mantras-to-interrupt-imposter-syndrome.html) blog
  post.
* Completed a [Forensic Accounting and Fraud Examination course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/forensic-accounting) on Coursera. It was fine, but what I really wanted was [Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/) for accounting.
* Created and hosted two remote trivia nights with Maya.
* Finally made public [_A System for Email,_]({{ site.baseurl
  }}/articles/a-system-for-email.html) notes from a class I ran for many years
  at Square and then later at Bradfield CS.

### Memory

I wanted to experiment with spaced repetition software (SRS) as a technique for memory and
learning, so worked my way through this [968 card geography Anki
deck.](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2109889812) It includes all countries,
their capitals, flags, and locations, along with major oceans, seas, and
other significant regions. Many years ago I learned all the capitals using a
more cognitively demanding visual association technique, so that part was
somewhat of a refresher, but the flags and locations were new.

Using default new card settings but with random ordering, with a couple of
bonus review sessions, it took me 45 days to see every card at about 10 minutes
study a day. I would often do a secondary session reviewing recently forgotten
cards to help load them into my brain --- SRS is more designed to facilitate
recall rather than initial learning. After that, daily review time dropped to
only a couple of minutes and falling. I usually do it with breakfast.

![Monthly review count]({{site.baseurl}}/images/anki-2020-resized.png)

<center><em>Monthly review count. Note the yellow "cram" sessions and ramp
in volume into month two when learning all the cards, and the transition to
fewer, darker green mature cards as the deck was learned.</em></center>

<p/>

I deliberately restricted myself from more focused study on weak areas, wanting
to see how far SRS could get me by itself. After 100 days, my trailing 30-day
correct averages for learning/young/mature cards are 100%/97%/91%. I've
struggled in the last mile on similar answers that I didn't initially learn as
a group, such as the location of Pacific and Carribean islands,
Budapest/Bucharest, or the red & white flags of Poland, Indonesia, and Monaco.
These would benefit from more focused study. For whatever reason there are also
a couple that simply failed to stick with flashcards alone (Anki marks them as
_leeches_ if you forget them four times) and I need to develop visual
associations to actually remember, for example Zambia, Lithuania, and the South
China Sea.

### Games

A lot more time indoors this year meant a lot more gaming than typical.

* **Celeste.** Really tight platformer with phenomenal sound track. Learned the
  speedrun sufficiently to get a [sub-60 minute run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2x2VpnfEzo).
* **Krastorio 2.** A well polished Factorio mod that adds just the right
  amount of extra complexity and new mechanics without going overboard. Didn't
  quite get through the whole late game, Factorio Layout Designer was started
  as a way to design the next factory I needed, but I never actually came back
  to my save.
* **Grim Dawn.** Had a couple of dark weeks early lockdown, put in a pretty
  serious grind on this. What Diablo 3 should have been.
* **Overwatch.** Got a hankering for team sports, decided to try and learn how
  to play the tank role from no prior experience. Ranked into bronze, got a
  lesson on what I was supposed to be doing --- best $20 I spent this year ---
  then added about 1000 SR to high silver before feeling sufficiently satiated
  to move on to other things. Wish I'd stuck with the grind a little longer,
  was just starting to get somewhere.
* **Slay the Spire.** A rogue-like deckbuilder. I played a lot of this genre
  over the year (honorable mention to **Monster Train**), Slay the Spire was
  the one I kept coming back to. I also really enjoyed the Downfall mod, which
  adds a large amount of new content.
* **Hexcells Infinite.** Revisited this minimalist puzzler to clear out a few
  of the puzzles I didn't get in my first play-through, ended up making my own
  [Halloween themed
  puzzle](https://www.reddit.com/r/hexcellslevels/comments/jhn6bm/spooky_halloween_puzzle_medium/).
* **Hades.** Take all the best parts of Bastion's combat, put it in a
  rogue-like frame, and add just an increbile amount of story.

## 2021

Looking forward to getting to know my Digitone a bit better. I'm torn between
getting back into a marathon training plan or sticking to trails for a bit
longer. At least the training will be somewhat complementary either way.

Got a hankering for team sports after watching _The Last Dance_ documentary on
Michael Jordan and the Bulls, and decided to join my local field hockey club.
That has been on hold for six months due to the pandemic and then accident
recovery, but I'm still keen to try it. Haven't played since I was 17 so will be
interesting to see if it sticks.

But overall I really just want to get back into the office with people and put
this pandemic behind us, if that becomes possible!
