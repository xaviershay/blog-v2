Not usually a fan of collections of blog posts, but this works. There is enough glue and cohesion to make it read like a book - definitely a page turner.

Everyone will get something out of this book (except maybe if you've devoured his blog) - lessons for being a CEO apply in virtually every endeavour, and it's much more real than a typical "business book".
