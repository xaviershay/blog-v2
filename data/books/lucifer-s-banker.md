In the hands of a good journalist this could have been 5 star material. Author becomes investment banker, makes a killing in Switzerland helping US citizens evade taxes, whistleblows the whole thing, spends 3 years in jail, gets $100M reward from the IRS for the largest ever recovery of taxes.

Unfortunately the author spends the entire book trying to convince you that he's a rich angry douche bag, and it's nearly unreadable. I was begging the judge to put him away.
