Overall this book contains important ideas and data, but is too detailed for a casual reader like myself. I’d recommend reading the introduction, then skimming everything up to Section 4 before reading to the end. The middle is useful technical analysis for those who care about that level of detail. I look forward to see what further research and policy follows from it.

Favourite snarky quote: 'It may be excessive to accuse senior executives of having their “hands in the till,” but the metaphor is probably more apt than Adam Smith’s metaphor of the market’s “invisible hand.”'
