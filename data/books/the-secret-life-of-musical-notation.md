If you play piano (or possibly any classical music), this is a 5 star book. Totally changed how I read music, and it makes far more sense to me now.

(I'm curious how this book was received in the scene, i.e. is the author full of shit, but w/e I'm just an amateur and it enhanced my enjoyment of music so that's good enough for me.)
