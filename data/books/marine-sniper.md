Some trash for the plane, actually decent - stalking the general and nemesis sniper were highlights. Also finished with Carlos' (hard) integration back into society which was nice touch - gave the coda a bit of a Catch-22 oh-god-the-horrors-of-war feel. (Or at least that's what this hippie read into it.)

Aside: as a result I thought I might enjoy watching American Sniper film on the plane back but I was wrong it was a terrible movie. Not cringey bad just boring and shallow. I think I actually found this book coz the reviews of American Sniper (the book, showed up in Amazon recoms) said to read this instead.
