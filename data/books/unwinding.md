I had no idea what this book was beyond the title going in, and was somewhat disoriented for the first third.

Once it got rolling though I was hooked. Almost like a modern day grapes of wrath. Covers the hopes, dreams, and day to day of various Americans, both famous and ordinary, from the start of our generation through the loss of jobs to export, bush/obama, the financial crisis, occupy.

Highly recommended.
