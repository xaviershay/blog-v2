This would be five stars if the repetition was stripped out. It was a conscious decision to repeat stories about the featured "contemporary master" (it's called out in the intro), but I just found it redundant.

Aside from that, excellent writing on mastery - what is is, how to go about developing it, plenty of case studies. Lots of interesting biographical detail and morsels to think about.
