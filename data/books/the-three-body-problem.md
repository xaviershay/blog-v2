So many people recommended this to me. What is wrong with y'all? The writing is bad, the plot doesn't make any sense, characters are boring, it's got stupid VR stories ... the only reason it gets two rather than one is it did start to touch on some interesting issues around contacting extra-terrestrial life. But even then not in a way that was particularly compelling.
