First faulkner I've read. Breathtaking at times, and then other times I got bored.

“She wants to pray, but she don’t know how to do that either.”
"And him being a kind of fierce little old man that a man wouldn’t cross without he thought about it first."
"‘He don’t need any help,’ he thinks. ‘Not him. It’s hindrance he needs’;"
"I imagine that after thirty years the machinery for hoping requires more than twenty-four hours to get started, to get into motion again."
