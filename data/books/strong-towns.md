First book in the field I've read so all new to me. Plenty of unintuitive insights. Inspired me to read my city council's annual report.

Didn't feel particularly rigorous though - both with use of historical stories and current data - , which leaves me suspicious. But curious to learn more.

> he social return can be enormous, and we can develop all kinds of optimistic ways to suggest that it is, but if the investments we’re making don’t pay a real return – if we don’t create enough wealth to pay for the investment and its long-term maintenance – it’s not going to matter much. The accumulated weight of negative-returning investments will weigh us down, forcing us to divert more and more of our resources from things that could improve our lives to sustaining systems that never will.

> The scary thing is that all cities that take on debt for infrastructure maintenance believe they have a cash-flow problem. They believe this despite not having done the analysis to determine whether this is true. The example I’ve given is ridiculously simplified: four streets over four years. Cities sometimes have hundreds of miles of streets with maintenance occurring over decades. A local government must be obsessively intentional, organized, and disciplined to discern its true financial status.
