Recipes look quite good, though pretty American. Introduction is eager, informal, selective/sloppy with facts (or at least: doesn't provide enough context to make claims believable - extraordinary claims, extraordinary evidence), does provide some good links to more information though.

Disclaimer: I just read "Should you eat meat?" which is the polar opposite style of this book, so I wasn't feeling particularly tolerant.

I have one friend with a personality who I think this book's style might appeal to, for the rest I need to find a different primer.
