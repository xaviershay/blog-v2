Decent habit discipline is the #1 thing that allows me to capitalise on my
luck. I read Atomic Habits a few weeks ago. Great refresher, led to tweaks:
crisper triggers, “get to” reframing, speaking out loud, and more.

I’m crisper about my triggers. New ones which have led to greater consistency:
when I wash conditioner out of my hair, turn off the tap. When I go to open an
app on my phone, open flashcard app instead (if not done for day.)

When I get to my desk, write my TODO list for the day. This was becoming
inconsistent and needed a boost.

Noticed I hadn’t attached anything to “when I get home from work”. Don’t know
what I actually want to put there, so currently it’s “pick a candidate habit
and do that”. (Candidates include: rehab exercises, music practice, pull ups.)

I suspect “pick from options” is the most realistic candidate, because while “get
home from work” is consistent the context varies wildly - are we going straight
back out again? Am I home by myself?

Replacing “have to” with “get to”. Neat form of gratitude practice I wasn’t
doing. Also useful in reacting to others: “tram broke down” / “what an
opportunity, you got to walk!” Often gets a laugh and puts conversation on a
positive track.

Announcing out loud. “We’re not going to walk back past Pie Thief, because I
will 100% buy a pie I don’t need.” Return path doesn’t matter, purchase now
very unlikely. (J, not helping: “...what about half a pie?”)

Some quotes that have stuck in my head but don’t yet have a clear link to a behavioural change:

> Winners and losers have the same goals.

> You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

> Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is clarity.

> Never miss twice. [..] The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit.

> People get so caught up in the fact that they have limits that they rarely exert the effort required to get close to them.

> Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.

Anyway read the book, it’ll make you better.
