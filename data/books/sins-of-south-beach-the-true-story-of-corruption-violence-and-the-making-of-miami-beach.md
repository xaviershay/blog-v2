What I wanted: A harrowing tale of an ethical man turned bad by circumstance.
What I got: An untrustworthy narrator whose self-reported emotional state swings wildly between cliches, depressingly never showing any real spine. I'm torn between depression for a system that encourages such behaviour (paying mayors only $10K/year), to pity/lack of respect for a man who ultimately doesn't consider himself in the wrong - even though he openly admits what he was doing was wrong, and he knew that, facing a federal grand jury he expresses feels he deserves to be found innocent even after been offered a fairly generous plea bargain and deciding to fight, complaing that he doesn't have enough money and having to sell his multi-million dollar mansion. Wat.
