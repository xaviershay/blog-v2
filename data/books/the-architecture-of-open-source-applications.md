Each chapter is written about a different application by a different author, and the quality varies widely.

The following are worth reading (and available online at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="http://www.aosabook.org/en/index.html">http://www.aosabook.org/en/index.html</a> though I read the kindle version):
* Graphite
* LLVM
* Selenium Webdriver
* Python packaging
* SnowFlock
