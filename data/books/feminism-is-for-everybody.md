5 stars because everyone should read it - a short overview of feminist theory which is one of those things you probably think you know about but actually don't (something I see a lot with veganism). At least, that was the case for me.

My technical criticism - it's very anecdote heavy without supporting data - is likely unfair for an introductory book, though it would have appealed to me more if some of this was present.
