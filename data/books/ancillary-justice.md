Two examples:
1) the mixing pronouns I liked as an idea: everyone is "her", except when a character is speaking in a different language in which case "him/her". That's interesting! But in practice there were no other indicators about which language was been spoken and I couldn't quite keep track of who was who (is that "he" the same as the "her" from the last sentence?) without a decent amount of re-read.

2) The whole premise of the AI-as-one-but-sometimes-multiple was also interesting! But again, was mostly pretty confusing.

 I feel like I'd probably enjoy a re-read a lot more.
