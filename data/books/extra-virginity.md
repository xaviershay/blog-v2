I read the first chapter in the gift shop of a winery/oil-maker up in Napa while waiting for friends. Figured it would be worth finishing, and it was. I knew nothing about oil, now I know something. Pretty short read.

tl;dr fraud is endemic in the industry and the Extra Virgin Olive Oil you bought at the supermarket most likely isn't. I'm pretty sure now I've never tasted proper oil.
