## Habits

* Read a book (see my [reading list for the year](/articles/2021-reading-list.html)).
* Anki cards.
* Gratitude journal.
* Cold shower.

Starting my shower cold was a new habit this year and surprisingly it stuck all through winter.

Exercise habits fell off this year due to injury, which includes the yoga habit I was hoping to build.

For [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) I kept up geography and the periodic table, but added nothing new.

## Sport

I was excited about getting into climbing this year, but it only lasted a month. Between climbing, yoga, lifting and running I overdid it and injured my back at the start of February. I was off and on with running only through March until I got a proper diagnosis (it was presenting as glute trouble), after which things continued to get worse. By April I couldn't sit and had trouble walking. The first two weeks of May I took as "pretend" recovery from surgery, taking some time off from work and lying down all day. This didn't help, and I scheduled a cortisone injection for the 13th May. This helped significantly. I was able to sit for short periods, and commence physical therapy which enabled me to start steadily improving. By the end of May I had my first basically pain free day.

I started walking with very short jogs in mid-June, did my first workout at the start of August. I've been able to run consistently since, with the only exception two weeks off due to a stomach bug in late August.

### Running

As a result of injury, this was my lowest yearly mileage in a while, only just topping 2000K.

Pre-injury I was in good shape but just running for fun. Highlight was probably a [solo trail marathon up Mt Buller](https://www.strava.com/activities/6566342999).

Post-injury, I did manage to salvage the year and work back up to a 3-day, 200K stage race in WA. This was my longest ever race, and the most volume I've ever done in a week (let alone three days!). [I wrote it up separately.](/articles/gssr-report.html) I also got around the [Two Bays 28K course as solo effort](https://www.strava.com/activities/8272606126).

## Projects

### Music

Not being able to sit down, I wasn't able to practice piano for much of the year. So I learned a new instrument! Since April(TODO) I've been taking trombone lessons. I'm finding it quite difficult. Progress is slow but steady.

As of TODO I'm practicing piano again as well.

### Programming

* Migrated my blog from Jekyll to a [homebrew static site generator](https://github.com/xaviershay/blog-v2).
* Migrated my book reviews from Goodreads to [this site](/books/).
* Wrote code to [analyze dot-matrix displays on Williams' pinball machines,](https://github.com/xaviershay/dmd-analyzer) with extraction algorithms for Demolition Man. Never got it working on a live machine because [couldn't get a reliable feed out of PIN2DMD.](https://github.com/lucky01/PIN2DMD/issues/21)
* Learned how to make GLSL shaders, made a [neon triangle tunnel thing](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/7lScWV).
* Implemented a decent chunk of [_The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants_ in Haskell.](https://github.com/xaviershay/plants)
* Published a lightning talk [Solving Factorio with Math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVXcc4CGEoo) giving an overview of some work I did in previous years.
* Published a [Cargo Rocket tutorial for the Factorio Space Exploration mod.](https://github.com/xaviershay/plants)

### Pinball

We moved office at work, and I'd promised the team a new pinball machine to
celebrate. That turned into quite a project, trying various machines, going
along to competitions, and even trying my hand at basic maintenance on our
current machine (Demolition Man).

### Games
