Really solid biography, though 20 years old and he's done a lot in the last 2 decades. Touch sycophantic at times, but not so bad. I didn't really know anything about him, now I do! If you're thinking about any sort of investing you should read this.

"“Never lose money” is an unyielding standard; it forecloses the option of taking any speculative risks."

"Buffett noted that the Du Ponts “might believe themselves perceptive in observing the debilitating effects of food stamps for the poor” but were themselves living off a “boundless” supply of “privately funded food stamps.”"

"In the end we must have people to match our principles, not the reverse."

"If you gave me $100 billion and said take away the soft drink leadership of Coca-Cola in the world, I’d give it back to you and say it can’t be done."

"“Maybe I’m a little crazy about this,” he admitted, “but if you practice a faith, you go to the church."
