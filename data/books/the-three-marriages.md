Picked up after reading about it in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2015/06/the-three-marriages/">https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2015...</a>

I highlighted a decent chuck of this but nothing much stuck beyond that blog post.

Felt similar to an Alain De Botton book - rather reassuring to read without being earth shattering.
