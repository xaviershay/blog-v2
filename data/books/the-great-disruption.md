Fantastic high-level book from former Greenpeace CEO and environmental consultant Paul Gilding. He directly addresses activist nihilism ("everything is fucked what's the point") at a time when I needed it. He's not optimistic in the "everything will work out fine" sense, but talks from direct experience figuring out what role he was going to play. If you're feeling down about the climate situation, have a read.
