Post-hoc rationalization of a typical failed mainstream relationship. Takes common emotional traps and pathological behaviors (i.e. fighting between partners, failures to be honest) as a given without exploring whether or how they can be avoided. Probably succeeds at providing light emotional comfort to victims of the same, but provides nothing to help them avoid broken relationships in the future. At least it was well written.
