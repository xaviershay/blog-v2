Really useful. In particular, introduction to using 90th percentile confidence intervals has already started to change how we discuss things at work.

Have half-heartedly tried to apply estimating cost of information on a real problem. Didn't really make it work, guess I was hoping it would be magic without having to properly think about it!

Some later chapters are (deliberately) a bit specific to certain scenarios - good to know they exist but can skim for now.

Needs to be paired with some critique. For example, yes you can objectify and measure human performance in knowledge jobs ... but if most attempts at doing so create bad cultures, that points to an issue with the theory.
