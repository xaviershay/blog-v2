Tough one to review: I definitely learned a decent amount, and it's incredible that this happened, but the story of how it came together is ... not that interesting? More data leaked, needed bigger computers, needed to involve more journalists, repeat until done. Nearly didn't finish it.

> As of November 2016, according to the ICIJ, 6,520 individuals and companies were under investigation worldwide due to the Panama Papers. 110 million US dollars had already been recovered â€“ and this was in just four countries (Colombia, Mexico, Slovenia and Uruguay). Nearly 100 countries had launched their own investigations, inquiries and audits.
