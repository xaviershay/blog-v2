This felt like a really good overview of the issues, but ... I'm not really sure what I took away from it that wasn't already in my brain, except for these bits I highlighted:

> Children born into a society in which misdeeds are made impossible or extremely difficult will not learn what it feels like to choose not to break the law.

> The evidence, however, suggests that technological advance in the twentieth century actually boosted the number of low-education tasks in the economy as well as the number of high-education tasks. It was middle-education tasks that declined in number.
