Had been sitting on my shelf at work for a while, finally polished it off.

Knuth is a pretty incredible dude. He wrote TeX without even running it and basically nailed it. I didn't really take anything away from the book though. Everything is so totally old school it's hard to relate, and writing programs to be read is SO MUCH EASIER with the languages we have today. I feel pretty spoiled, actually.
