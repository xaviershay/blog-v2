decent collection of blog posts, plenty of ideas to think about. Note: "sociopath" in subtitle is a reference to a previous book with a (imo) strained re-definition.

"If your team can’t escape certain consequences when things go wrong, by saying “my manager said it was okay,” you are not doing enough for them."

"one of the easiest ways to figure someone out is to look at the information they choose to consume."

"Discussing ideas is only a sign of great minds if events and people – both matters of context and motivation – have been adequately dealt with."

"This is a tough idea for win-win types to accept: vindictive pushback is a very rational reaction."
