call me a philistine but this is really just self-important white guy rambling. I mean yeah there's some basic wisdom in there - Cyrus seems pretty legit for the time - but nothing not covered by modern, better written books. As a historical item it's interesting, but not worth it unless you're really interested in a biased view of the times.
