Macguyver in space, with science. Which is does really well, I just found myself wanting something else. Like characters with emotional complexity. Or some actual tragedy. Mark could have gone insane, someone on the Hermes could have died, bit more politicking back on earth, you know that sort of thing. Probably tells you more about me than the book.
