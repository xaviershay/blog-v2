Went on a bit but key insight was to maintain a sense of separateness.

> My belief, reinforced by twenty years of practice, is that in the course of establishing security, many couples confuse love with merging.

Also felt like non-monomagy was taboo (except for what felt like a tacked on final chapter), but the author clearly has opinions if quoting statistics like:

> Despite a 50 percent divorce rate for first marriages and 65 percent the second time around; despite the staggering frequency of affairs; despite the fact that monogamy is a ship sinking faster than anyone can bail it out, we continue to cling to the wreckage with absolute faith in its structural soundness.
