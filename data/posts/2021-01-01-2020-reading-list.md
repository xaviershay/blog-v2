I read fifty books this year. Anticipated it might be more due to the lockdown, but probably actually read less than normal during that period.

Top picks are below, and you can find the full list over [at
Goodreads.](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/2875383-xavier-shay?read_at=2020&sort=rating)

## Non-fiction

#### The Outlaw Ocean _by Ian Urbina_

Incredible journalism from an extremely committed author. Accounts of
smuggling, trafficking, pirates, poaching, slavery, and more. Lot of things I
didn't really know about.

#### The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking _by Edward B. Burger_

Really practical, short, got much more out of it than I thought I would. In
particular, the worked examples were really effective.

> If you are a teacher or a manager, instead of asking, “Are there any
> questions?” assume there are, and say, “Talk to your neighbor for sixty
> seconds and write down two questions.”

## Sci-fi & Fantasty

#### Nexus _by Ramez Naam_

A trilogy set in the near future centered around a new nano-drug that enables
people to link minds. Ticks all the boxes: cracking plot, realistic science,
sets up many ethical dillemas and viewpoints, avoids annoying tropes.

#### Six of Crows _by Leigh Bardugo_

Action packed fantasy heist duology. Witty and fun. (Bardugo also earned a
mention in [last year's list]({{ site.baseurl }}/articles/2019-reading-list.html) with _King of Scars_.)


> “It’s a terrible story,” said Matthias. “I doubt it’s true. It’s just what
> happens when you let men name the bridges.”

#### Blindsight _by Peter Watts_

I've never read anything like this, and I want more. Don't want to spoil any of
it. Mind opening.

> "Still. There's always a way to win." "If I said that, you'd call it wishful
> thinking." "If you said that, it would be. But I'm saying it, so it's game
> theory."

## Literature

#### Fleishman Is In Trouble _by Taffy Brodesser-Akner_

Funny and poignant story of divorce. Not a combination I expected.

#### Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead _by Olga Tokarczuk_

A Polish murder mystery, I guess? Took a while to reel me in but couldn't put
it down by the end.

> ‘Would you like a cup of coffee?’ He flapped his hands. ‘I don’t drink
> coffee.’ Plainly, he wasn’t very bright. If he were, he’d have known that I
> wasn’t interested in his culinary likes and dislikes.

## Bonus: TV

#### The Bureau _by Éric Rochant_

A French spy drama based on real accounts by former spies. Five whole
seasons to enjoy! Jodie and I were hooked: watched two episodes a night
consecutively for nearly a month.

#### Borgen _by Adam Price_

Danish political drama following a centrist politician becoming the first
female Prime Minister of Denmark. The third season (which we're only halfway
through) feels a bit like an add-on, enjoyable but not quite at the same level
was the first two.
