tl;dr rent control and regulation distort the market and suppress creation of high density housing that would actually help fix rent issues. Gentrification unavoidable if you improve an area - as services, proximity to transport, etc improve then it becomes more desirable and kicks off a cycle.

Didn't get heaps out of this, but it was really short, more like an extended essay, so three stars.
