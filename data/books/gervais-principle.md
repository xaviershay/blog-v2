Fun and useful analysis of organisations through lens of the office. I found the archetype labels (loser/clueless/sociopath) obscuring to underlying concepts just because they carry so much baggage ... but on the other hand they do make sure you're thinking about it.

Don't need to have seen much of The Office, just a passing knowledge of the characters.
