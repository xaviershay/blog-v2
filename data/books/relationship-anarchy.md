> “I relate to others in a different way”

Relationship Anarchy is the application of anarchist principles to the personal
realm. Primarily:

> the concepts of freely accepted and revisable commitments, responsible
> autonomy, and personal sovereignty - an ethical tripod.

This doesn't mean individualism however:

> In ideological terms, relationship anarchy is by no means a praise of
> individualism and freedom as a rejection of commitment and solidarity. It
> isn’t related to the liberal tradition.

While often considered in the same sphere, relationship anarchy has a distinct
history, development, and ideological basis from other dominant non-monogamous
models. Non-monogamy is _possible_ within this framework, but it is a secondary
implication and isn't _assumed:_

> an anarchist relationship is first and foremost one of cooperation and
> setting our own rules. By that definition, it is not self-serving but always
> mutually beneficial. By that definition, it can be a monogamous relationship
> if that’s what makes the people involved feel happiest. By that definition,
> it can be about friendship, about romance, about sex, about a selection of
> those things, but by definition it will be about care.

Anarchy has accumulated a number of harmful stereotypes in mainstream culture
that are not present in the actual ideology. For example, to counter a popular
myth:

> Anarchists are not against organization or structure; rather, they object to
> organizations or structures that are based on unequal relations of power or
> are maintained coercively.

This quote from Noam Chomsky captures it nicely:

> I think that all authority has to be justified. That any hierarchy is
> illegitimate until proven otherwise. Sometimes, it may be justified, but most
> of the time, it is not. And that... that is anarchism.

### Labels & Normativity

Relationship anarchy seeks to do away with _labels_ such as "couple" and "friend"
(described as _normative_: establishing norms of behaviour, which may not
have been consciously agreed to), instead attempting to explicitly and freely
define the commitments and scope of relationships independent of these labels:

> we must pay attention to the possibility that these labels condition us.
> They’ve got baggage. If we’re not highly attentive to this, we will bring in
> authoritarian behaviors, automatic rights over others, the expectation that
> they behave “like they should” with me – how “everyone knows” they should, as
> someone who accepts that recipe for a pre-cooked plate of rights and
> obligations.

That said, labels can be useful, particularly when interacting with the rest of
society. They don't need to be avoided, but used with care:

> If I’m aware that labels are double-edged swords, that I have to pay special
> attention when using most tools to avoid hurting myself or someone else, I
> will be able to identify those dangers and avoid them to the extent that I
> deem appropriate at different times: perhaps today, I’ll risk using a
> chainsaw, because I need it now and the danger is worth it, even though I
> know I can hurt myself if I’m not on guard.


### Commitments & Autonomy

> relationship anarchy doesn’t ever suggest avoiding commitment; rather, it
> suggests that you can design your own commitments with the people around you
> according to the circumstances, affinities, and the very course of events.

There is an inherent tension in designing commitments while respecting autonomy
and personal sovereignty:

> Among the many difficulties I can find in putting this into practice, the
> most basic ones are: how to distinguish a free and voluntary commitment from
> a concession stemming from an implicit agreement associated with imbalances
> of power and lack of assertiveness?

> I also have to be able to renounce that communication without feeling as
> though I am repressing or curtailing my freedom of expression. It’s a complex
> balance, and my impression is that it should be weighed as a cost-benefit
> calculation: if I express all my impulses and desires, even going so far as
> reproaching when they’re not fulfilled, I am being transparent and exercising
> my assertiveness; at the same time, I may be applying pressure and giving
> rise to more or less subtle emotional coercion and blackmail.

Further complicating is that (totally reasonable and likely) emotional states
make this hard:

> Even with strong motivation, states of anxiety and lack make it more
> difficult to maintain behaviors that respect other’s autonomy.

Fundamentally, the idea of freely-entered commitments respecting our own agency
is really tricky:

> The consequences of applying an anti-authoritarian and anti-oppressive
> paradigm to the dynamics of self-management at the relational and affective
> levels go through recognizing the great difficulty that normally involves
> detecting and neutralizing these invisible forms of violence and, thus,
> looking at the idea of negotiation with suspicion - assuming that there are
> asymmetries and imbalances, power gradients that induce us to accept
> concessions regarding our agency and our boundaries. But without demands and
> cessions and a process of negotiation and agreement, how can I come to an
> understanding in my relationships that lets me be at ease? It’s not easy to
> answer this question.

A reframing of commitments helps though:

> A responsible commitment, however, is not an exchange: it is the recognition,
> expression, and celebration (because I think this should be experienced with
> at least some enthusiasm) of a purpose that is voluntary and adaptable as
> well as reliable and firm. Again, it would be naive to say that nothing is
> desired in return. There are always expectations of reciprocity, which is
> surely understandable, but there are no demands.

### Personal Sovereignty

Where Relationship Anarchy departs most from other relationship ideologies is
the inviolability of personal sovereignty and autonomy.

> Above all, no one grants their own personal sovereignty in exchange for the
> personal sovereignty of another or others.

While it takes commitments, community and solidarity seriously, it views
negotiations about aspects outside the "shared space" of a relationship with
scepticism and concern:

> Evaluating how ethical it is in terms of my moral principles – whether
> they’re close to anarchism’s not – to negotiate aspects that go beyond my
> body, my presence, and my direct interaction. Assessing whether it is an
> exchange between equals or coercion, as well as assessing whether everyone
> who may be affected now and in the future are represented in the negotiation.
> Since it is practically impossible for those who will be affected in the
> future to participate in coming up with the agreement, assessing whether it
> is really ethical to include elements besides those involved only in the
> interaction at hand – that is, whether it’s ethical to negotiate what can or
> cannot be done outside of shared spaces and times.

Transparency---at the extreme, a commitment to share everything---would be a
violation of this principle, but honesty in a relationship seems like a
fundamental requirement. Relationship Anarchy reconciles this by introducing
the concept of _sincerity_:

> Sincerity, understood as the need to share what’s important – everything that
> involves those in a relationship – is a value.

That doesn't mean it is easy to manage, but it does provide language to at
least
discuss it:

> The most difficult aspect that requires careful analysis is distinguishing
> between sincerity and transparency. As I mentioned in the previous chapter,
> there is little doubt that honesty is a commitment that should be part of any
> ethical relationship. But this commitment’s exact structure doesn’t have to
> be automatic. In fact, how it is managed is a highly relevant aspect.

### Not Poly

The book spends some time contrasting its approach against more dominant
strains of consensual non-monogamy.

> However, the bibliographic material that seems to have a more significant
> role in constructing polyamorous identarian sentiment employs an empowering,
> subversive expressiveness. Its expository model, though, is sometimes more
> reminiscent of self-help guides than political and social reflection or
> analyses of oppressions and power structures.

It characterises polyamory as adapting normative approaches to be applicable
beyond the couple:

> Polyamory is a coherent ethical response to having to choose and give up one
> person to get closer to another, but it is still a response within the
> framework of the relationship escalator.

As another example of a typical difference:

> In the case of relationship anarchy, when establishing new relationships,
> there would not be a demand for explicit authorization and management of
> potential conflict from the community’s members. This is like how, when we
> traditionally “meet someone”, we don’t think about how this new connection of
> camaraderie will affect each of the people we’re already friends with – much
> less do we meet with each of them to manage it.

### Conclusion

> the best readings are those that reveal that what you already intuited...
> wasn’t just in your mind.

Despite the overly-academic language, this was a valuable read that gave me
plenty of new insights. It is [available for free
