On Facebook [Drew](https://www.facebook.com/drewringsmuth) asks, in relation to yesterday's [Melbourne Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Cup):

> Given that the average Australian pays to eat dozens (hundreds?) of animals

Indulge me in making the case.

People eat animals. Their parents ate animals. Their children will eat animals.
For most people, eating animals is a superbly entrenched habit. It doesn't
matter through what violence that meat comes to be: to the animals, the
environment, or the factory farm communities.  It is a testament to the power of habit, tradition, and
motivated reasoning that widespread intensive meat consumption persists despite the awesome horror of modern animal food production.

As an activist, I have rarely found direct assaults on such deeply entrenched
habits effective.
People shut down quickly when their foundations are questioned, and terminate
conversations quickly with ethically absurd "tasty murder" cliches.

### Enter Horse Racing

In the Melbourne Cup we find a festering nexus of gambling, binge drinking[^2],
and easily substitutable entertainment, that 364 days of the year no one gives
a shit about.

This presents a tantalizing line of attack to the concerned vegan. Most people
have no customary attachment to horse racing. It's just a stupid thing everyone
does every year. There is little cost nor shame to recognizing the inherent
cruelty of the event, at least when compared to food. Particularly given such
a gentle[^3] yet emotionally sticky hook as the [favourite horse running last then keeling over](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-11-04/admire-rakti-collapses-and-dies-after-melbourne-cup/5865932). A second horse being [shot after breaking a leg](http://www.theage.com.au/sport/horseracing/melbourne-cup-2014-araldo-dies-after-breaking-leg-20141104-11gx2z.html) provides further ammunition.

The Melbourne Cup practically _invites_ you to renounce it. And importantly, this is
becoming an acceptable mainstream position. Even Murdoch-owned _The Australian_
published a couple of [anti-racing][a1] [opinions][a2] this year.

Surely it is rational for an activist to stoke the flames?

Disavowing the Cup is a good, safe warmup. Level one animal rights. Heretical thoughts can be entertained—maybe we shouldn't be needlessly cruel to
animals?—with little fear of upsetting deeply held customs.
Planting that first seed of doubt and reflection is the hardest step for us activists.
We need to sow it wherever we can.

[^2]: Literally the "worst sporting event for alcohol intoxication and assaults during and before the event" in Victoria, according to a [government report](http://www.vichealth.vic.gov.au/Media-Centre/Media-Releases-by-Topic/Alcohol/Melbourne-Cup-number-one-day-for-bingeing.aspx).
[^3]: I know that's a weird adjective. I'm comparing to say, [Earthlings](http://earthlings.com/), which is too fucking crushing to be anyone's first exposure.
