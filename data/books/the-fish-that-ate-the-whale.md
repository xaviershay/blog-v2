Fun history of the banana trade in America, centered on the "Banana King" Sam
Zemurray. A flawed character (i.e. literally instigated a coup in Guatamala),
but they're the most interesting ones to learn from.

> “This man in Guatemala, he’s your manager, isn’t he?” Zemurray asked. Yes.
> “Then listen to what the man is telling you. You’re here, he’s there,” said
> Zemurray. “If you trust him, trust him. If you don’t trust him, fire him and
> get a man you do trust in the job.”

Gave some context to just how thouroughly the trade permeated central America.
Have a much better sense of the term "Banana Republic" now.

> By 1942, the company owned 70 percent of all private land in Guatemala,
> controlled 75 percent of all trade, and owned most of the roads, power
> stations and phone lines, the only Pacific seaport, and every mile of
> railroad.

And a particularly great boardroom takeover scene:

> “You gentlemen have been fucking up this business long enough. I’m going to
> straighten it out.”
