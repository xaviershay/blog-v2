Solid book on habits, contains a refreshing amount of science. Am not changing much because of it, but I did like this research which tempers the oft offered (including by myself) of how long it takes to form a habit: "What this research suggests is that 21 days to form a habit is probably right, as long as all you want to do is drink a glass of water after breakfast. Anything harder is likely to take longer to become a really strong habit, and, in the case of some activities, much longer."
