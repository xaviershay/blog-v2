I like how he threads his own personal story through a summary of research. Very accessible, particularly since I'm not really interested in technical detail. Key takeaways:

* Old people living with family tends to be idealized, but actually it kind of sucks and no one does it if they have money to avoid.
* Historically doctors (and other professions!) have been paternalistic, more recently have become informative, but really need to become interprative - helping patients make sense of choices, not just presenting them - to be effective.
* Hospice care is good!
* Doctors and children need to have difficult conversations with elders to figure out how they want to live the end of their lives. Living just for the sake of living sucks.
