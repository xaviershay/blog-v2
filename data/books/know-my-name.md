Autobiographical account of a victim going through a highly public rape trial.
Not comfortable reading, but important.

> During trial, the jury was forced to pick; is he wholesome or monstrous. But
> I never questioned that any of what they said about him was true. In fact I
> need you to know it was all true. The friendly guy who helps you move and
> assists senior citizens in the pool is the same guy who assaulted me. One
> person can be capable of both. Society often fails to wrap its head around
> the fact that these truths often coexist, they are not mutually exclusive.
> Bad qualities can hide inside a good person. That’s the terrifying part.

> This is not about the victims’ lack of effort. This is about society’s
> failure to have systems in place in which victims feel there’s a probable
> chance of achieving safety, justice, and restoration rather than being
> retraumatized, publicly shamed, psychologically tormented, and verbally
> mauled. The real question we need to be asking is not, Why didn’t she report,
> the question is, Why would you?
