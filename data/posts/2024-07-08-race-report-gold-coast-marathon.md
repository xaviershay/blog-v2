I last raced a marathon 12 years ago on four weeks of training and no
nutrition. It went about as well as you'd expect. Finally got around to having
another go.

> yeah body feels ok, struggling a bit on motivation. am thinking maybe training for gold Coast mara. just get started on something

Training ostensibly started sixteen weeks out on 18th March, following a solid
month of recovery (some physical, but mostly mental) after DNF'ing Hut2Hut (a
mountainous 100K).  At this point I had no intention of actually racing, I just
needed to get back on a training plan. The only way I know to cure a running
rut: more running.

I was excited to run a bit faster after so much slower trail training.

For three weeks of April I was travelling internationally. First two weeks in
the US mostly for work I kept overall decent volume but didn't fit in any long
runs. The final week I was in the Galapagos which was awesome ... but terrible
for running. On my return I spent a weekend in Warburton tooling around trails
... which I needed most of the next week to recover from. I don't feel like I'm
seriously training at this point, but I'm back running again and it feels good.

Eleven weeks out Tim (my coach) caught me at a vulnerable moment:

> Have you thought about your next race option? I had someone offer an entry to
> the Gold Coast Marathon if you were still looking to chase a ticket there.
> You've got a lot of fitness at the moment and your workouts have been good
> quality.

I bought flights and accomodation that day.

From there I had a really solid build, averaging about 80K a week over five
runs. Typical week was easy run Monday, workout Tuesday, medium-long Thursday,
long Saturday, easy Sunday.

I was trying to squat on Wednesday and Sunday, with minimal accessory work, but
it wasn't until the last four weeks that I was able to make this consistent.

### The Weekend

Caught the winners finish the Half. Weather was on-and-off raining. Bounced around cafes eating and reading.

### Race Day

A goal: don't blow up. Don't race for time. This is only the first one.
B goal: don't injure myself.

The plan: go out with the 3:10 pacer (4:30/k pace), and if I felt good coming through 32K to
push to the finish. Given the temperature, drink at every aid station,
electrolytes where available. Eat 100C every 45 minutes ([six
jellies](https://www.coles.com.au/product/the-natural-confectionery-co.-vegan-fruit-flavoured-jellies-lollies-180g-3843800)),
which probably isn't enough but I hadn't trained on enough to target more.

And that's pretty much how it went.

Pacers deliberately went our a little on the fast side, coming through 5K in
4:23s, and it felt really comfortable. Heart rate sitting around 150, low end
of Z3.

My watch spasmed through 12K, showing an early 4:00/k. I re-lapped it manually at the 13K marker to line it back up.

Probably drank too much early, as I needed a bathroom break just before the half way mark. I jumped a little ahead of the pacers 2k out from the toilet, figuring I'd get a small recovery and wouldn't have to make up as much. Total stop time: 55s, and now behind pacers. I was still under 3:10 pace, but judged I'd be better off sitting in a group so increased pace to 4:15/k for next 6K to get back on the bus. This pushed HR to 155 â€“ still comfortable but as high as I wanted to go until much closer to the finish.

I can't remember exactly when I floated ahead of the pacers again, but it was not long after the race came back through the start line, so about 32K. I didn't find another gear, but I was feeling alright to untethered myself. I gained some ground but my legs really started hurting. I hadn't blow up, but I was dragging: kilometre 37 was my first slower than 4:30 (excluding bathroom break), followed by :32, :33, :38, :38. (This was also into a headwind, and the sun had come out. Can't imagine that helped.) Pulled it together for a 4:27 followed by a kick down the chute to finish.

Final time: 3:08:34. A goal achieved.


ate 6 (six) oreos in the hour before the race (~300C), then 100C of jellies every 45 minutes except the last.  need to get that up. drank at every aid station except one where the cup i picked up was empty ðŸ˜­ it wasn't tooo warm, but much hotter than Melbourne and i was worried about expiring. 






Jodie and I spent a week in the Galapagos islands in April. There were a lot of animals!

## Day One

Fly into Santa Cruz, the biggest populated island. Met by an iguana. Checked out a sinkhole on the way to our accommodation. Lunch at BahÃ­a Mar, where a sea lion had reserved the choicest tables. Excellent vegan ceviche!

Walked around the Charles Darwin Research Centre and saw some giant tortoises.

## Day Two

Small group boat ride to Plaza Sur, a tiny island that's only a mile to walk around. Sea lion pups playing in the shallows and iguanas. Struggled around a short run in afternoon heat.

## Day Three

Hike to Tortuga Bay. More iguanas. A baby hammerhead shark in the shallows. Afternoon ferry to the second biggest populated island, San Cristobel. Dinner at Midori Sushi Pub, excellent food and cocktails.

Small group boat ride to Playa Cerro Brujo to hang out of a bit, then on to snorkelling at kicker rock, a boot shaped rock formation off the coast. Jodie free dove with sea lions, turtles, sharks, the lot.

In the afternoon visited the local beaches of San Cristobel. Jodie swam with sea lions pups while I hiked around the rocks.

Repeat dinner at Midori Sushi Pub.

## Day Five

Sunrise run on northern trails for me, walk along the foreshore for Jodie, before flying out to Quito.

## Day Six (bonus)

We had a full day in Quito before our flight. Caught the cable car up to 4,100m for some incredible views of the city ... except it was covered in cloud. Went for a run around the city and Parque La Carolina

## Miscellany

Vegan food relatively plentiful. Accommodation provided breakfasts, and boats
provided lunch --- simple but sufficient.

It's a long way away. Melbourne to LA or San Francisco, then to Quito via
Houston, then to Santa Cruz island with a touchdown at Guayaquil on the way.
About 36 hours all up. Thankfully we were already in the US prior to shorten
the trip and so only the return trip was excessive.

Would have benefited from brushing up our Spanish a bit beforehand, but you can
muddle through anything with phone translation.
