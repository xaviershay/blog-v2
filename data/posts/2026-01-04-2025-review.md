Every year I review my habits, exercise, and projects for the previous year.

## Daily Habits

No changes from the last couple of years:

* **Read (part of) a book.** Finished 43 in total. Wrote up my [top picks for the year.](/articles/2025-reading-list.html)
* **[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) cards.** Have added new cards for birds I've seen, using an [automated script.](https://github.com/xaviershay/sandbox/tree/main/anki-ebird)
* **Gratitude journal.** I record both things I did well, and things that brought me joy.
* **Prehab.** Bare minimum stretching.

In addition I also tracked the following but didn't commit to any frequency:

* **Set of pull-ups.** Daily with occasional rest days, plus a few gaps from travel and minor niggles. Typically between 8-10.
* **Set of push-ups.** Same frequency as pull-ups but more consistent through travel. Usually 15-25.
* **Alcohol-free day.** Didn't have any drinks in the back half of the year. Non-alcoholic beers are in a golden era right now.

I use and recommend [Loop Habit Tracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.isoron.uhabits&hl=en_SG) and [Gratitudes Journal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bailouni.gratitudes&hl=en_SG) to keep track of things.

## Sport

### Running

Worst running performance year in a long while, and lowest volume since 2017 --- didn't even crack 2,000K.

Trained well for Ballarat Marathon in April but was sick for the month
leading into it so dropped down to pace a friend in the half. Ended up working
[much harder than I would have liked](https://www.strava.com/activities/14296195237) for a 95min finish.

Got started again in May and had a solid seven week build into a local half
marathon ... that was on a Wednesday morning that I had to skip because of a
work committment. Did a [solo effort myself](https://www.strava.com/activities/14967160252) the day before in 88min which felt
strong, and was my one redeeming effort of the year.

Springboarded into a training block for Melbourne Marathon but reinjured my
glute at the end of July which was really stubborn. Combined with some other
illness, didn't resume running regulary until December(!)

Run of the year was an [early morning trail run in Joshua
Tree](https://www.strava.com/activities/13815439212) where it had unexpectedly
snowed overnight. Stunning!

I ran with Hunter Athletics Tuesday mornings around Olympic Park, and joined a
new club Ate Miles for social mid-week and weekends.  I continued to be coached
by Tim from the [Distance Collective.](https://www.thedistancecollective.com/)
Sorry I didn't give you much to work with this year!

## Birds

Birding was my new hobby this year, along with bird photography. I [saw 243
species,](https://birds.xaviershay.com/firsts?type=sighting&period=2025) photographing 155. It's been a great way to "see with new eyes", and
it's rewarding being able to recognise all the birds and bird calls in my area.
Helps that Jodie is in to it also!

## Projects

* Built a [homelab](/articles/holiday-homelab-recap.html)
* Consolidated DNS from [DNSimple to Cloudflare](https://blog.xaviershay.com/articles/migrating-from-dnsimple-to-cloudflare-dns.html) using Terraform.
* [Balatro hand calculator](https://share.unison-lang.org/@xaviershay/balatro-bench) in Unison
* [Tetris clone in Zig](https://github.com/xaviershay/tetrafall), that didn't get very far. (In retrospect, many of the issues I ran into were related to a new version of Zig coming out two weeks before I picked it up.)
* [Tetris clone in Haskell](https://github.com/xaviershay/tetrafall-hs) that got a lot further, though was mostly having fun with [different randomisation algorithms.](https://github.com/xaviershay/tetrafall-hs/blob/main/src/Tetrafall/Randomizer.hs)
* Maintenance on my Factorio mod, [Floor Placer,](https://github.com/xaviershay/factorio-mod-floor-placer) and a [quick spotlight video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vprXePljV3E)
* Brushed up on Abstract Algebra and wrote an [intuitive explanation of a fun result about ruler & compass constructions.](https://xaviershay.github.io/sandbox/ruler_and_compass.html)
* Proof-of-concept app for [recording bird sightings verbally.](https://github.com/xaviershay/voicebirder/)
* Site to [host all my bird data and photos.](https://birds.xaviershay.com/)
* Script to [integrate bird data into Anki.](https://github.com/xaviershay/sandbox/tree/main/anki-ebird)

## Games

Strong year for games.

* Played through [Tactical Breach Wizards](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043810/Tactical_Breach_Wizards/) in February, a fun and well put together tactics game.
* Picked up [Balatro](https://www.playbalatro.com/) again in May to complete all the challenge runs and finally 100% my collection. Nearly beat gold stake on all decks but petered out.
* June and July were primarily [Backpack Battles](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2427700/Backpack_Battles/) ranked up to Platinum
* TODO and [Clair Obscur: Expedition 33](https://www.expedition33.com/).
* Returned to [Factorio](https://factorio.com/) in August to pick up the final two achievements (sub-40h finish and no destroyed nests until artillery), then played through as [many new planet mods as I could find](/articles/factorio-modded-planets-review.html)
* Hades II came out of early access in October and felt incredibly fresh despite having the same setting and basic mechanics as the first one.
* Returned to Celeste to finally 100% it (finished Farewell and Core C-Side), and started playing through the [Strawberry Jam maps.](https://gamebanana.com/mods/424541)
* Back to Factorio to finish the year, this time finally tackling the [Pyanodon's mod collection](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/pymodpack). It continues to be my forever game --- I've been playing it since 2017 and have accumulated over 1,700 hours.
* Have now solved 528 [NYTimes crosswords](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords) total, most with Jodie.
