I ran from Geneva to Chamonix over five days with Tour de Trails, then extended my stay in Chamonix. In total over the ten days I covered <span data-alt='125mi'>200km</span> distance and <span data-alt="32,800ft">10,000m</span> of elevation in about 32 hours of moving time.

### Day 0

<em><span data-alt="7mi (±650ft)">12k (±200m)</span></em>

After arriving in Geneva a day early, caught a [sunrise over the lake](https://www.strava.com/activities/9341658708) and then explored Parc la Grange.

Met up with the crew for brunch at _Oh Martine!_  cafe – great food, tunes, and vibes – to drive to our accommodation in Evian. We were staying in a beautiful old style lodge.
Afternoon [shakeout run](https://www.strava.com/activities/9344487277) up around some local single track, then relaxing in the pool.

### Day 1

<em><span data-alt="7mi (+3,150ft, -2,150ft)">11k (+960m, -655m)</span></em>

Short day to kick things off, with a [solid climb up to Col de Pavis](https://www.strava.com/activities/9356629146). Had lunch and a swim at Lac de Darbon, then up and down ridges towards Refuge de Bise. Found a gnarly, steep and rocky off-trail detour where the trail was eroded. Saw many farm animals.

### Day 2

<em><span data-alt="19mi (+6,400ft, -4,100ft)">31k (+1,950m, -1,250m)</span></em>

Climbed out from the refuge then a big descent down into La Pantiaz for a baguette stop. A few <span data-alt="miles">K</span> on the flat through town along the river before climbing <span data-alt="3,000ft">1,000m</span> back up to Les Mattes. We then stayed up high all the way to catch the gondola back down to Champery. Bit of a grind along fire trail in overcast weather on the back third but still rewarded with some phenomenal views.

### Day 3

<em><span data-alt="17mi (+1,650ft, 4,650ft)">27k (+540m, -1,400m)</span></em>

Back up the gondola to start the day up high. Only rainy day for the tour, and it was the day for it! Heap of extra muddy [fire trail to lunch](https://www.strava.com/activities/9362804312) at a refuge, then gave it the beans down an outrageously <span data-alt="2,400ft">750m</span> [fun descent along more fire trail and gorgeous forest single track](https://www.strava.com/activities/9362807531) before finishing just outside town.

### Day 4

<em><span data-alt="15mi (+5,330ft, 2,560ft)">25k (+1,625m, -780m)</span></em>

Run out of town to a waterfall, with a pinchy climb to the top. Regrouped there, then forged ahead and buried myself on the [climb up to Col d'Arteme](https://www.strava.com/activities/9368458019). Lot of other groups on the route meant people to chase! Another refuge lunch, then briefly [up above the snow line](https://www.strava.com/activities/9368513007) with some fun snow crossings. Saw some marmots! Fanged it back down the hill to finish.

### Day 5

<em><span data-alt="17mi (±5,570ft)">27k (±1,700m)</span></em>

Took it a bit easier today, lot of good chats. Fun single track descent to the river then [found an abandoned ruins](https://www.strava.com/activities/9375827644) for lunch. Kept ascending in the afternoon to the highest point on the tour at Le Brévent, with many fun snow crossings along the way. Descent into Chamonix was spectacular: beautiful single track with stunning views. We're done!

### Interlude: Chamonix

I was supposed to be flying home at this point, instead I was convinced to extend my trip for some extra days in Chamonix. This turned out to be an excellent idea. Chamonix is _such a cool town._ Completely walkable, heaps of vegan food, stunningly beautiful under the shadow of Mont Blanc. Nestled in a valley, it's right on the doorstep of adventure in every direction.

A selection of establishments we brought custom to:

* **Arctic Juice.** Frequent morning option for juice or smoothies.
* **Moody Coffee Roasters.** Apparently the coffee is good, but they also have peanut butter cups.
* **Sesame.** All plant-based, burgers and falafels were good.
* **Annapurna.** Solid Indian cuisine.
* **Poco Loco.** Hash browns in burgers, full marks.
* **Barracuda.** Small bar with a forbidden cage (???) and so-bad-its-good music that lights the bar on fire sometimes.

### Extra Day 1

<em><span data-alt="9mi (+550ft, -4,265ft)">15k (+170m, -1,300m)</span></em>

Most of the crew was still around. We caught the gondola up to Aiguille du Midi (<span data-alt="12,600ft">3,842m</span>) for some spectacular views. I hopped off at the half way point on the way down and [ran back down into town solo.](https://www.strava.com/activities/9379588175)

### Extra Day 2

<em><span data-alt="8mi (±3,000ft)">13k (±1,000m)</span></em>

Pulled an all nighter so wasn't feeling super hot, but still managed a [loop out of the valley and back](https://www.strava.com/activities/9387025833) with Bonnie and Celeste including a "fun" ultra steep off road detour around a very large downed tree.

### Extra Day 3

<em><span data-alt="7mi (±3,000ft)">12k (±1,000m)</span></em>

Had a serious crack at the [vertical kilometre route](https://www.strava.com/activities/9391231065) from the church up under the gondola to Planpraz. Intended to catch the gondola back down, but why do that when you can run!?

### Extra Day 4

<em><span data-alt="15mi (±4,800ft)">24k (±1,465m)</span></em>

Long day to finish with Bonnie, Tia and Rijan. Found a [glacier with an ice cave in it!](https://www.strava.com/activities/9399432730) Some cute refuges. Amazing single track, pretty much par for the course by now.

### End Note

I don't have enough good to say about our [Tour de Trails](https://tourdetrails.com/) guides Chris, Mish, and Celeste. It was such a fun, social group, and they managed the logistics, differing paces, and dietaries with aplomb. They run tours in other fun places like the UK, Crete and Bali – if you are even a little bit curious check them out. Highly recommended. And I'll definitely be finding my way back to Chamonix...
