Does exactly what it sets out to do: a history from the perspective of regular people, rather than statesmen. Particular things I found interesting:

* History of the labour movement in the 1800s, continuing through the 1900s.
* Recurring theme of expansion to find new markets for products.
* Context around the US entering WW2 and subsequent wars.

The author admits in an afterword that it is weak particularly with regard to latina influence in the western states and LGBT history, though provides recommended reading to fill those gaps.
