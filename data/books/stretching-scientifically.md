Skimmed through it in an hour or two. Dense on the info, a bit too much for what I was after. Well worth the $15. I was able to extract what I wanted though:

- Static stretching before a work is bad (knew this, but science confirms)
- Stretching with a partner is a bad idea - you need the strength to stretch yourself to be safe.
- Isometric stretching (which I've never tried) is the fastest way to splits-with-no-warmup, but still need dynamic and static active for other types.

The end result is I've started doing a quick dynamic stretch in the morning just after I get up, and isometric stretches after workouts or in the evening. Going to see how that tracks over a month.
