Every year I review my habits, exercise, and projects for the previous twelve

## Daily Habits

* **Read (part of) a book.** Finished fifty-two of them in total. Wrote up my [top picks for the year.](/articles/2023-reading-list.html)
* **[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) cards.** Another year of the same geography and element cards. This is maybe three cards a day.
* **Gratitude journal.** I was specifically grateful for ice-cream on nine occasions.
* **Prehab.** Bare minimum stretching and exercises for my back.

In addition I also tracked the following but didn't commit to any frequency:

* **Set of pull-ups.** Ended being mostly daily, with occasional rest days. Started the year at set of three, increasing to eight currently.
* **Set of push-ups.** Same frequency as pull-ups. Usually 15-25.
* **Alchohol-free day.** I drank about once a month for the first half of the year, once a week for the back half and a bit less than every other day for December (mostly courtesy of [Carwyn Cellars Canvent...](https://carwyncellars.com.au/products/carwyn-canvent-2023)).

This coming year is going to look fairly similar I think, I'm not feeling the need to change much up.

I use and recommend [Loop Habit Tracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.isoron.uhabits&hl=en_SG) and [Gratitudes Journal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bailouni.gratitudes&hl=en_SG) to keep track of things.

## Sport

### Running

Despite some minor setbacks and very little racing, It was a great year for
running. I continued my focus on longer trail events,  PRing my 50k at
Warburton Trail Fest in March on my way to 3rd place in the multi-day event.
Three weeks later I ran my first 100K as part of the Buffalo Stampede Ultra
Grand Slam multi-day event. It felt strong, though following it up with a 42K
the day after was too much and I needed six weeks of virtually no running
afterwards to rehab my right knee. That was followed by a month of base
building before a massive social trip to first Hawaii (100K week, 4,500m vert.
One third backpacking) then Sweden/French alps (135K week, 7,000m vert).

Was feeling strong coming home, but fell sick three times over the next few months before discovering (and having removed) an infected tooth, all of which took at least a week each out of training.

That caused me to bail on both Hume & Hovell 50K and Surf Coast 100K, but I did manage to be healthy enough for a decent crack at 4peaks at the start of November.

December was a solid month, including double workout weeks with 40k+ long runs in the back half. Hopefully I can keep momentum into Hut2Hut 100K mid-Feb.

I often ran with Hunter Athletics Tuesday mornings around Olympic Park, Studley
Park Run Club around the Yarra trail Thursday evenings, and Dandenong Trail
Runners on Sunday.

For the whole year I traversed 3,050K, my most ever, while climbing nearly 80K, fully double my previous max.

### Other

I restarted my bouldering gym membership in July but rarely managed to climb
twice a week. I'm not intending to train this but hope to keep going socially
this year.

I nearly got a twice a week strength habit going to support my running, but was
tough to keep restarting bigger lifts everytime I got sick. Did a little bit
better with easier prehab work, but in general want to try and do better here
in 2024. That said, I've never previously been able to make anything stick
alongside running, so I'm still happy with a partial success this year.

We got a table tennis table at work, and a few of us went along to a group
training at MSAC a couple of times. I really enjoyed this but I'm not going to
make time for it in addition to everything else.

I did a handful of introductory BJJ classes just so I could know what everyone
else was talking about. Again, not going to make time for another sport
properly though.

## Projects

* Created a [solver](https://github.com/xaviershay/sandbox/tree/main/potionomics) for [Potionomics recipes](https://potionomics.com/), and gave a lightning talk about it.
* Created [sternbot](https://github.com/ferocia/sternbot), a scraper for Stern Insider to create a slack leaderboard and achievements tracker for our Godzilla pinball machine at work. (Achieved a 1B+ score on the machine as well.)
* Added a [running section](/articles/new-blog-feature-running.html) to this site.

### Games

* Completed both the Exotic Industries and Freight Forwarding modpacks for
  Factorio, and got most of the way through a replay of K2.
* Enjoyed a full run of Midnight Suns, a brilliant tactics game trapped in a
  AAA shell.
* Played a lot of Legends of Runeterra PvE, a AAA deck builder.
* After trying and failing to get into Diablo IV, leveled a
  Demolitionist/Inquisitor in Grim Dawn instead to finish Ultimate difficultly
  for the first time.

I also enjoyed Potionomics, Age of Wonders 4, and Per Aspera.
