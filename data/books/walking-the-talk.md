Didn't feel the need to marinate it the way I do other business books, but I reference this a lot so 4 stars.

Specifically to my needs, the link between innovation and risk management:

> However, because Innovative Cultures expect to take steps into the unknown frequently, they have also developed very good risk-management processes.

The use of platitudes people can't disagree with without getting into the details for the expected behaviours:

> Assume that if you say ‘teamwork’ to your people, they will believe they are already doing it.

Dunning-Krueger for managers:

> A study asked managers to rank themselves as communicators. One hundred per cent of those asked ranked themselves in the top 50 per cent. Half of those asked ranked themselves in the top 10 per cent.

Behaviours/Symbols/Systems (which Justin refers to often and is what got this book on my radar in the first place)

> Behaviours – the behaviour of others, especially those who appear to be important Symbols – observable events, artefacts and decisions to which people attribute meaning Systems – mechanisms for managing people and tasks Two things to remember from this: Culture is about messages: culture management is about message management. If you can find, and change, enough of the sources of these messages, you will change the culture. Culture is about what is really valued – demonstrated through what people do, rather than what they say.
