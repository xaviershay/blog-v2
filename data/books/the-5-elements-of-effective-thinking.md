Really practical, short, got much more out of it than I thought I would. In particular, the worked examples were really effective.

<blockquote>If you are a teacher or a manager, instead of asking, “Are there any questions?” assume there are, and say, “Talk to your neighbor for sixty seconds and write down two questions.”</blockquote>


<blockquote>For example, take a political, personal, business, academic, or other issue and create an extremely exaggerated perspective on the subject. If you are arguing one side of an issue (whether or not it is the side you truly believe), make the argument so exaggerated that you realize that it’s way over the top. Now study your exaggerated description and discover some underlying defect. Does that defect exist in your original, nonexaggerated perspective?</blockquote>
