[Braeside Wetlands](https://www.parks.vic.gov.au/places-to-see/parks/braeside-park) is a small state park about forty minutes south east of Melbourne. Today I bought my first pair of binoculars ([GPO Passion ED 8x42](https://gp-optics.com/product/passion-ed-8x42/)) and wanted to try them out. I feared it would be too hot, and while the water level was quite low there were still [plenty of interesting birds around.](https://ebird.org/tripreport/341048)

    <td><b>Gray Fantail.</b>
    First bird I found, if you ignore the Noisy Miner grabbing a drink from the fountain at the car park. Definitely much easier to identify with magnification!

In addition I saw plenty of more common birds I've seen before including Pacific Black Ducks, Swamphens, Coots, Miners and a solo Willie-wagtail. Dipped on identifying any [Shovelers](https://ebird.org/species/aussho1) but according to a woman with a large camera they were around. There were plenty of ducks I wasn't sure about so this was probably one of them. Also saw a bird with shape and beak of a kookaburra but darker that flew off before I could figure it out, and probably two [Australian Reed Warblers](https://ebird.org/species/aurwar1) but I didn't back myself enough to call them.
