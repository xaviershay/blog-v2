I didn't know anything about Palestine, so this was kind of jumping in the deep end. Many references to things I didn't know about, but also since it was a collection of essays + discussions, there was a lot of repetition so I was able to pick it up. Would normally have docked it a star for that, since objectively it's a format I don't really like, but in this case happened to be a match for me.

Short and punchy. I want to learn more.
