There's definitely a goldilocks mindset for reading this series: pay too much attention and it makes no sense, but not enough and you've no idea what's going on. Found myself in the latter camp more often than I'd like.

Still, really liked the Mars setting, and wasn't pleasant enough to wash over me even when I wasn't really sure what was happening.
