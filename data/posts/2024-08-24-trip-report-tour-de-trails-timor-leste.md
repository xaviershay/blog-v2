I ran 90k through Timor-Leste over five days with Tour de Trails. Any of the good photos in this post were taken by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/whatnowtim/">Tim.</a>

### Day 1

<em><span data-alt="7mi (+2,950ft, -2,300ft)">12k (+900m, -700m)</span></em>

A couple of hours in the van to our starting point at Asumanu, for a <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/12101286381">half day</a> run to start the tour.

First segment was some incredibly steep single track descent of <span
data-alt="1,600ft">500m</span> down to a river, then back up again. Weather:
hot.

Visited an old encampment of some Australian soldiers from world war II,
and a secret cellar used by the resistance. Camped in tents outside a guest house in Fatubessi.

### Day 2

<em><span data-alt="17mi (+3,000ft, -4,500ft)">27k (+1,000m, -1,500m)</span></em>

Longest day of the trip, and another hot one, from <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/12101286623">Fatubessi to Datu Rua.</a> Long
descent to a wider river fording and a coconut break. Beau subsequently
schooled me on the sharp <span data-alt="2.5mi">4k</span> climb to the finish.
Another night in tents in a local family's backyard.

### Day 3

<em><span data-alt="8mi (+3,700ft, -1,700ft)">13k (+1,100m, -530m)</span></em>

Most runnable day yet from [Data Rua to
Atsabe.](https://www.strava.com/activities/12101286392) Lot more fire trail.
Went to see a waterfall after and spent a few hours there while Chris tried to
recover his crashed drone. Roadside cup noodles - very strong.

### Day 4

<em><span data-alt="19mi (+6,400ft, -4,100ft)">31k (+1,950m, -1,250m)</span></em>

Summited Mt Ramelau, the highest point on the island at <span data-alt="9,797ft.">2,986m.</span> Fast and fun descent to a guesthouse for the night.

### Day 3

<em><span data-alt="17mi (+1,650ft, 4,650ft)">27k (+540m, -1,400m)</span></em>

Back up the gondola to start the day up high. Only rainy day for the tour, and it was the day for it! Heap of extra muddy [fire trail to lunch](https://www.strava.com/activities/9362804312) at a refuge, then gave it the beans down an outrageously <span data-alt="2,400ft">750m</span> [fun descent along more fire trail and gorgeous forest single track](https://www.strava.com/activities/9362807531) before finishing just outside town.

### Day 4

<em><span data-alt="15mi (+5,330ft, 2,560ft)">25k (+1,625m, -780m)</span></em>

Run out of town to a waterfall, with a pinchy climb to the top. Regrouped there, then forged ahead and buried myself on the [climb up to Col d'Arteme](https://www.strava.com/activities/9368458019). Lot of other groups on the route meant people to chase! Another refuge lunch, then briefly [up above the snow line](https://www.strava.com/activities/9368513007) with some fun snow crossings. Saw some marmots! Fanged it back down the hill to finish.

### Day 5

<em><span data-alt="17mi (±5,570ft)">27k (±1,700m)</span></em>

Took it a bit easier today, lot of good chats. Fun single track descent to the river then [found an abandoned ruins](https://www.strava.com/activities/9375827644) for lunch. Kept ascending in the afternoon to the highest point on the tour at Le Brévent, with many fun snow crossings along the way. Descent into Chamonix was spectacular: beautiful single track with stunning views. We're done!

### Interlude: Chamonix

I was supposed to be flying home at this point, instead I was convinced to extend my trip for some extra days in Chamonix. This turned out to be an excellent idea. Chamonix is _such a cool town._ Completely walkable, heaps of vegan food, stunningly beautiful under the shadow of Mont Blanc. Nestled in a valley, it's right on the doorstep of adventure in every direction.

A selection of establishments we brought custom to:

* **Arctic Juice.** Frequent morning option for juice or smoothies.
* **Moody Coffee Roasters.** Apparently the coffee is good, but they also have peanut butter cups.
* **Sesame.** All plant-based, burgers and falafels were good.
* **Annapurna.** Solid Indian cuisine.
* **Poco Loco.** Hash browns in burgers, full marks.
* **Barracuda.** Small bar with a forbidden cage (???) and so-bad-its-good music that lights the bar on fire sometimes.

### Extra Day 1

<em><span data-alt="9mi (+550ft, -4,265ft)">15k (+170m, -1,300m)</span></em>

Most of the crew was still around. We caught the gondola up to Aiguille du Midi (<span data-alt="12,600ft">3,842m</span>) for some spectacular views. I hopped off at the half way point on the way down and [ran back down into town solo.](https://www.strava.com/activities/9379588175)

### Extra Day 2

<em><span data-alt="8mi (±3,000ft)">13k (±1,000m)</span></em>

Pulled an all nighter so wasn't feeling super hot, but still managed a [loop out of the valley and back](https://www.strava.com/activities/9387025833) with Bonnie and Celeste including a "fun" ultra steep off road detour around a very large downed tree.

### Extra Day 3

<em><span data-alt="7mi (±3,000ft)">12k (±1,000m)</span></em>

Had a serious crack at the [vertical kilometre route](https://www.strava.com/activities/9391231065) from the church up under the gondola to Planpraz. Intended to catch the gondola back down, but why do that when you can run!?

### Extra Day 4

<em><span data-alt="15mi (±4,800ft)">24k (±1,465m)</span></em>

Long day to finish with Bonnie, Tia and Rijan. Found a [glacier with an ice cave in it!](https://www.strava.com/activities/9399432730) Some cute refuges. Amazing single track, pretty much par for the course by now.

### End Note

I don't have enough good to say about our [Tour de Trails](https://tourdetrails.com/) guides Chris, Mish, and Celeste. It was such a fun, social group, and they managed the logistics, differing paces, and dietaries with aplomb. They run tours in other fun places like the UK, Crete and Bali – if you are even a little bit curious check them out. Highly recommended. And I'll definitely be finding my way back to Chamonix...
