Another extended essay. Interesting novel take-aways:
* There is quite a lot of science detecting thoughts/actions before the subject is conciously aware of them.
* Accepting that behaviour is caused by physical processes suggests a far more compassionate justice system that what we have currently.
* ... though vengeance may still be an important psychological need.
