description: A review of a selection of modded planets
---

I added every new planet mod I could find to Factorio. Fun! I burned out before getting into proper late game and so didn't experience everything, but still got about 80 hours of enjoyment. Many of these are under active development and will be improved by the time you read this. And many [new ones have popped up as well!](https://mods.factorio.com/browse?exclude_category=internal&tag=planets&factorio_version=2.0) This is by no means an exhaustive list of new planet mods.

If you only try one make it [_Moshine._](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Moshine)

**Lignumis**

A new starting world based around wood. Moderately interesting, though I don't
love slower start mods. I built most of the way towards a rocket, but then an
update somewhere caused some incompatibility so had to uninstall and skip
straight to Nauvis.

**Mulana, Moon of Nauvis**

Adds an intermediary step for space science, needing to mine asteroids from the
moon. Some late game additions too that I didn't get too. Lot of new content in
this mod and I suspect I missed a decent chunk of it.

**Igrys**

Doesn't quite feel finished. Map generation is basic, minimal theming. Inserted itself into too many base recipes (like spidertrons).

**Cubium**

This looks like a really promising sequel to
[Ultracube,](/articles/factorio-ultracube-review.html) but I visited it too
early, bailed, then forgot to come back to it. Potentially some interesting
mechanisms for science production late game, it clashes with Maraxis in that
regard.

**Moshine**

The best of the lot. Everything on this planet was strong: the primary mechanic
(optical data and AI cores), secondary mechanics (mixed mining with a neodymium
flavoured twist, molten iron, webbed compute networks), custom art, map and sound
assets, tied together with a cohesive theme. It even had custom achievements!

It is mostly an isolated experience, as the AI cores don't work on other planets
and the infinite research is niche (quantum cores), but I didn't mind that. It
made it feel like a completable side quest.

**Cerys**

A puzzle box moon containing a number of unique and tricky mechanics to progress. Super interesting.

**Terra Palus**

Another take on dark world, not at all finished or playable though.

**Maraxis**

What if we could build factories on the sea floor? Conceptually I loved this planet. Pressurised domes needed to house most buildings, salt processing, and a secondary deep trench layer with lava and great pressure. It explores having a +50% quality modifier on the planet-specific building, which leads to new challenges also.

In practice, while _interesting_ I didn't find it that _fun_. Domes created space constraints, and submarine automation was finicky. Still definitely worth a play through however. Didn't end up finishing its later content (new science production chain).

**Tenebris Prime**

Dark world with 100% evolution from gleba and also centipedes. No electricity, instead everything needs to be made biolumescent, which is also the only way to see. Very different, but at least put a better lamp in the tech tree! Interesting premise but overall a bit frustrating and production chain wasn't that interesting.

**Corrundium**

Nothing flashy but a good solid concept and execuption. Didn't end up teching to its signature lab however, which I imagine would pair nicely with Maraxis.

**Frozeta**

Enjoyed the flavour of having this be a moon of an extra planet Secretas, which other has no other function. Another take on scrap recycling ... in the snow. Was the last new planet I visited so rushed it, but felt like a solid "post Aquillo' progression.
