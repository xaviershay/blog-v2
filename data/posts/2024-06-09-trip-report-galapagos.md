Jodie and I spent a week in the Galapagos islands in April. There were a lot of animals!

## Day One

Fly into Santa Cruz, the biggest populated island. Met by an iguana. Checked out a sinkhole on the way to our accommodation. Lunch at Bah√≠a Mar, where a sea lion had reserved the choicest tables. Excellent vegan ceviche!

Walked around the Charles Darwin Research Centre and saw some giant tortoises.

## Day Two

Small group boat ride to Plaza Sur, a tiny island that's only a mile to walk around. Sea lion pups playing in the shallows and iguanas. Struggled around a short run in afternoon heat.

## Day Three

Hike to Tortuga Bay. More iguanas. A baby hammerhead shark in the shallows. Afternoon ferry to the second biggest populated island, San Cristobel. Dinner at Midori Sushi Pub, excellent food and cocktails.

Small group boat ride to Playa Cerro Brujo to hang out of a bit, then on to snorkelling at kicker rock, a boot shaped rock formation off the coast. Jodie free dove with sea lions, turtles, sharks, the lot.

In the afternoon visited the local beaches of San Cristobel. Jodie swam with sea lions pups while I hiked around the rocks.

## Day Five

Sunrise run on northern trails for me, walk along the foreshore for Jodie, before flying out to Quito.

## Day Six (bonus)

We had a full day in Quito before our flight. Caught the cable car up to 4,100m for some incredible views of the city ... except it was covered in cloud. Went for a run around the city and Parque La Carolina

## Miscellany

Vegan food relatively plentiful. Accommodation provided breakfasts, and boats
provided lunch --- simple but sufficient.

It's a long way away. Melbourne to LA or San Francisco, then to Quito via
Houston, then to Santa Cruz island with a touchdown at Guayaquil on the way.
About 36 hours all up. Thankfully we were already in the US prior to shorten
the trip and so only the return trip was excessive.

Would have benefited from brushing up our Spanish a bit beforehand, but you can
muddle through anything with phone translation.
