Figure out what you want to be able to do at eighty then work backwards. You
probably need to be a _lot_ stronger today due to inevitable physical decline.
Finally motivated me to get on top of some niggles I've been ignoring.

Wasn't just about "do exercise" though. What types of exercise? Why?

Also covers nutrition, drugs, mental health.

Found the discussion on evidence-informed vs evidence-based approaches insightful.

> It’s important, obviously, that our strategy be based on evidence. Unfortunately, the pursuit of longevity is where the most powerful tool of Medicine 2.0, the randomized clinical trial in humans, runs into a brick wall. Randomized controlled trials are used to determine cause and effect in relatively simple, short-term situations. It’s fairly easy, for example, to run a study showing that sunscreen prevents sunburn. But such studies are of limited use in our quest for longevity.

> People get old when they stop thinking about the future.

Highly impactful book.
