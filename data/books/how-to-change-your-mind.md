Very interesting. History of psychadelics, particular focus on research and healing community (as distinct from say, https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7442.The_Electric_Kool_Aid_Acid_Test ), along with author's own personal introduction. Last ~5 years have seen a resurgence in research and very promising early results on treating all sorts of thing: depression, addiction, existential anxiety in cancer patients.

Easy for me to relate to author because he too has a special hatred for new age music.
