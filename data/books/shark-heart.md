I can see why people love this book. Beautifully written. Didn't capture my
heart though, and I was thrown by the structure â€“ felt like it finished half
way through then started a new book.

> Wren no longer sees life as a long, linear ladder with a beginning, middle, and end. Instead, she considers how life is like a spiraling trail up a mountain. Each circling lap represents a learning cycle, the same lesson at a slightly higher elevation. Wren realizes she likes to rest as much as she likes to climb. She begins to enjoy the view.
