Nice short introduction to basic ways of misconstruing numbers such as mean/median averages, sampling bias, and correlation/causation mix ups. Plenty of examples. Not much in here if you're already numerically literate, but you can read it in two sittings. I expect it would be a particularly good book for those "bad at numbers" - it's very readable and straightforward.

Added to my list of books everyone should read during their education.
