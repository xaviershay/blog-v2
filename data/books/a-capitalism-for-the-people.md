A rare book that tries to bridge ideologies ("Just Food" also falls in this categories). Makes a distinction between pro-market and pro-business, and argues many convincing ways (backed up by research) that the former can start to solve many of the problems by the latter. A really grounded and practical book, with plenty of new ideas.
