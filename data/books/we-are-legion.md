Neat idea but wish it had engaged more with a particular topic rather than spreading so thin.

E.g. crushing loneliness of space, craziness of meeting yourself, meeting future relatives, meeting future humans full stop, nuanced conflict with enemy AI, but instead protagonist just rolled with everything. Meeting extra terrestrial life was dealt a cursory "hey STAR TREK PRIME DIRECTIVE lol nah".

Along another axis resource/time management and logistics could have been interesting but wasn't given any depth.

Also feel like books should be banned from referencing any nerd culture, it never lands for me. (See: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/electrolemon/status/971208968323280896?lang=en">https://twitter.com/electrolemon/stat...</a> )
