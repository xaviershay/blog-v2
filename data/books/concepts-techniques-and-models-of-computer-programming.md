Took a while, but I finally finished this. Plenty of good concepts in here, starting with dataflow variables (I didn't know the concepts) and building all the way up to distributed systems. Quite incredible to see pretty much all the computation models built up from the ground up with the bare minimum of parts. Breathtaking tribute to how simple programming can be.

It's a textbook, and trying to read it as a book rather than as reference for a semester is pretty dense going. In particular I found the formal definitions not particularly enlightening nor informative for the practicality of programming.
