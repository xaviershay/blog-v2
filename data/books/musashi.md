Simple story, plenty of wisdom quotes.

"Whether people were great or not, there was not much variety in their inner life experience. Any difference lay merely in how they dealt with common human weaknesses. To Takuan, both he and the other man were basically a bundle of illusions wrapped in human skin."

"We human beings all look up at the same moon, but there are many roads we may travel to reach the top of the peak nearest it."

Most of the characters, including all the main women, are totally batshit insane though.

It was almost down to a 3 but the amazing final line won it back the fourth:

"The world is always full of the sound of waves. The little fishes, abandoning themselves to the waves, dance and sing and play, but who knows the heart of the sea, a hundred feet down? Who knows its depth?"
