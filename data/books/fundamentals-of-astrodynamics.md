Exactly what it says on the tin. Covers how to calculate orbits, how to put things into orbits, how to transfer orbits, how to get stuff to the moon or other planets. Very math heavy as you'd expect, I skimmed most of it because I was really just after an outline.

Enjoyed the historical notes, i.e. "this is how newton/kepler did it" which I'm always fascinated by.

Probably should have brushed up on my calculus before diving into this.
