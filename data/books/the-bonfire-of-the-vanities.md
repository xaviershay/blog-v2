I ... didn't finish it? Similar experience to trying to read A Confederacy of Dunces - I don't like the characters, I know that's the point, but then it just goes on and on about it.

I love Wolfe's style and there's definitely some fantastic writing in here, but my god it goes on. Maybe if it was shorter I'd have stuck with it.
