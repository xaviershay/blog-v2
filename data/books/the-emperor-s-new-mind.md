Plenty of things for me to think about. Made a good case for consciousness *not* being computable on a turing machine, which is pretty awkward for AI. Would have liked it to be a lot shorter - spent a lot of time on things I was either familiar with (comp sci stuff) or couldn't follow (quantum stuff).

Would like to read an updated review, i.e. what has changed in the last 20 years that would support/detract from his arguments?
