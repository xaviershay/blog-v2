So the writing is cringeworthy (over-the-top internet self-help blogger), but the technique rocks. I've been doing it a week and it's been the most productive and fulfilling week I can remember. Having described myself as a morning person for a while now without really being particularly good at it, I'm excited to be back on the wagon. It's a fast read (easy to skim most of it) and only a couple of dollars on amazon.
