I don't even know how to star this.

On one hand, it clearly has some cultural resonance. Everyone in my social group (mixed gender) has read it and found a useful myth, i.e. "it helped me understand things I've felt". Often throughout the book I was in violent agreement: yes! Things should be more like that. It's entertainingly written, and the authors have fun with the material.

On the other, the "science" in this book is atrocious, especially given this was the authors' self-stated main purpose. It fails across the entire spectrum: from fundamental misunderstandings of natural selection to selective quoting of texts that actually argue the opposite of what they are quoting them for.

So where does that leave us? Clearly this book speaks to something that needs speaking to, but it is a story. Is it still useful? A modern day religious text?
