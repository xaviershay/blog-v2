I reckon I would have dug this 10 years ago but just not into it this time. Old guy travelling around places I don't care about, lot of the making-fun-of-stuff humour didn't work for me.

"To my mind, the only possible pet is a cow." &lt; this was a good paragraph though.

"I sat on the toilet, watching the water run, thinking what an odd thing tourism is. You fly off to a strange land, eagerly abandoning all the comforts of home, and then expend vast quantities of time and money in a largely futile effort to recapture the comforts that you wouldn’t have lost if you hadn’t left home in the first place." basically sums up my feelings about the book.
