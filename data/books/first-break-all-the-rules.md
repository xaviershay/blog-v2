I'm not a manager, but I learned a lot about myself reading this book (not least of which is I'd be a rubbish manager!) 

Big takeaways: 
- A talent is *any* recurring thought pattern. You can't change talents easily. A talent by itself is useless - need to convert to productivity.
- Don't try to figure out greatness by looking at failures. High and low performers often have the same traits that average performers don't have, so if you avoid traits of low performers you can also miss out on high performance.
