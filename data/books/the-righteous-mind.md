Best non-fiction book I've read this year. Everyone should read it, particularly those I know are going to be reading this coz all y'all Liberal As Fuck. Changed how I see the world, helped explain a lot. I might write a proper review at somepoint, but if not you can just read this one: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/books/review/the-righteous-mind-by-jonathan-haidt.html?_r=0">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/boo...</a>

Or you know, just read the book itself.
