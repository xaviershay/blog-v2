Biography of John Maynard Keynes, who I previously only knew nothing of except the economic school of thought he is famously known for.

Made me appreciate how his thought was shaped by real world experience: across both world wars, involvement in the arts, and a deep-seated desire to create the conditions for peace --- of which economics plays a critical role.

Also gave me a new lens into international relations around that time.

> Today, Keynes is remembered as an economist because it was through the field

> agenda was always deployed in service of a broader, more ambitious social
> project. Keynes was a philosopher of war and peace, the last of the
> Enlightenment intellectuals who pursued political theory, economics, and
> ethics as a unified design. He was a man whose chief project was not taxation
> or government spending but the survival of what he called “civilisation”—the
> international cultural milieu that connected a British Treasury man to a
> Russian ballerina.
