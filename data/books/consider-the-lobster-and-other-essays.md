Like everything he writes, this is absolutely brilliant. For this collection I was particularly impressed by his honest grappling with seriously hard questions, from the McCain 2000 campaign trail*, to the Maine Lobster Fair, to those raised in the course of a dictionary review, and more. The most thought provoking book I've read recently. Read it.

* Having just read about Roosevelt campaigning a century earlier on the same platform, the de ja vu was eerie.
