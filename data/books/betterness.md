Really strong rhetoric, likening business as we know it to traditional psychology (curing sick people), and suggesting the term "Betterness" to be the parallel to positive psychology. Further, that business has stagnated (ref: first decade of 2000s) and companies that are winning now are already embracing Betterness (Whole Foods, Walmart, Pixar, etc...).

I always find Haque inspiring. It's a short book, but probably could have been condensed into a long blog post. He does provide some good language for talking about this stuff that might stick (vision statement vs ambitions, for instance.)

Worthwhile read, but didn't shatter my world.
