Meb is such a sensible motherfucker. Nothing wrong with this, it's just boring is all. "Agility stretches, cross train, eat sensibly" etc etc.

I mean I guess if you want to be still in olympic condition at age 40 you have to be.

Not sure where the book is pitched though - not quite appropriate for beginners, not much meat for advanced.
