Reviewing the whole trilogy together, and that alone tells you something â€“ This is the first sci-fi or fantasy trilogy I've actually finished in a very long time. Lot of suspense, action, and interesting enough characters.

Re-read for reading of 4th book: trashy but fun. Feels more like reading a Netflix original and I really hope they don't mess up the adaptation.
