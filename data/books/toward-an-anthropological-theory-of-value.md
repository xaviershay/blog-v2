I am not the target audience for this book. I would have gotten a lot more out of it if I was a) an anthropologist, and b) more familiar with primary source material such a Mauss and Marx. Not that he doesn't explain them, it's just a lot to take in on a first pass.

It's more detailed that what I needed, but still plenty of interesting (technical) stuff about why different societies want different things and what might unify them.
