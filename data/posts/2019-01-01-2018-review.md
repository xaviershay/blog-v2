This year was a bit different. I left Square in February after seven years,
without much of a plan for what came next. Below are some excerpts from the end
of year review I did with myself. I've left out some of the stuff around bigger
life, relationship, and work goals since they are still forming.

## Work

I wasn't planning to do any work, but ended up taking on a good selection of
projects mostly towards the end of the year. This included some
[teaching](https://bradfieldcs.com/courses/leadership/), 1:1 coaching, "acting
CTO" roles, various other management consulting, and some programming. The
latter was surprising to me, I almost declined it---I haven't been paid to code
in 6 years---but decided to give it a crack to see if I'm still interested in
it. Yes, as it turns out. I didn't do any prospecting: all of these gigs came
to me through my network and referrals.

Throughout the year, I had about 10 distinct clients, billed around 600 hours
(15 weeks), and brought in around $US110K---some equity, mostly cash. My
effective rate varied pretty significantly, from free/reduced to $US750/hr
depending on project. I was generally about 60-65% loaded from July on a 40
hour week, with a spike up to 120% for a couple of weeks when I accidentally
said yes to too many things.

I enjoyed trying many smaller projects, rather than committing to one big thing.

## Habits

I had three daily habits this year, and I stuck to all of them, with the
planned exception of the week when I was backpacking:

* Read a book (see my [reading list for the year]({{ site.baseurl }}/articles/2018-reading-list.html)).
* 60s plank.
* 25 push-ups.

The latter two don't make me any stronger (you need periodization for that),
but I do them for maintenance and mental discipline.

This year also marked a full decade of veganism without me noticing. It's not
something I have to think much about anymore. It's amazing how much more
mainstream it is these days.

## Travel

At the start of the year we had grand plans for an epic US road-trip, Alaska to Mexico. That didn't happen: when it came to the actual logistics it didn't seem as fun as when it was still a dream. Instead, I spent a lot of time within California mostly on summer running adventures with [GGRC](https://goldengaterunningclub.org/):

* Lake Tahoe relay in June. 28 people across 4 teams and 2 houses!
* Hiking around [Hetch Hetchy]({{ site.baseurl
  }}/articles/hetch-hetchy-trip-report.html), followed by Meg and Ben's wedding
  at Evergreen Lodge.
* Lake Tahoe again with Mike and friends to tackle Mt Tallac.
* Camping and trail running in Sequoia National Park, another Mike special.
* Sequoia again a few weekends later with a different crew.
* Four Lakes Loop in the Trinity Alps with Shannon and friends.
* Healdsburg to support friends racing (and an epic bike ride).

To finish the year, [Ash](https://twitter.com/ashfontana) organised a 10-day
epic cycling trip to Mallorca, Barcelona and Girona in Spain. I was wholly
unprepared for this physically and was by far the worst cyclist on the trip,
but still had a great time.

## Running

2017 was plagued with injury, so my goal for this year was primarily to be more
sensible and stay healthy. For the most part, I was successful.

<center><em>Fitness vs. Fatigue over the year. Form is the difference. Note
the relative consistency in the first quarter of the year.</em><p/></center>

I started the year with an "easy" training cycle, targeting a 90 minute half
marathon at [Avenue of the Giants]({{site.baseurl}}/articles/race-report-avenue-of-the-giants-half.html) with Brent. This went very well. My training
was consistent and I hit the goal.

After a couple of weeks off I wanted to start another cycle, but was struggling
with a flu-type thing for a week. Then every weekend in June was a long weekend
away (above), so although I mostly hit my mileage, it was mostly all trails
and not a lot of quality road training. Hiking also took a week and a half out
of training, from the hike itself and then a few days after coping with some
excessive blisters. Overall this cycle was much more inconsistent, though I was
still feeling strong going into the Alameda Half mid-September. Unfortunately
it was my first ever DNF. Something was wrong with my foot and I had to pull
out after 30 minutes despite everything else feeling great.

I took the next two weeks pretty easy then had another crack at the Tiburon
Half. This was much hillier race, but I'm very happy with my performance. I
should have ended the season there, but given how good a shape I was in I was
hoping to get a PR this season so set my eyes on Healdsburg at the end of
October. I was just trying to do maintenance runs rather than train, but
mid-October my foot played up again more seriously and thus ended my running
season.

I was supposed to switch to the bike after Alameda to train for the Spain trip
in November. Instead, I kept running for an extra month, got injured, then the
smoke hit SF and kept me inside. As a result, this happened:

![How not to cycle]({{site.baseurl}}/images/how-not-to-cycle.png)

The bottom four rides were the extent of my training, an already too short
preparation cut shorter by the smoke at the beginning of November. The top two
weeks represents far too much time on the bike for my fitness level, and I was
still cutting rides short and taking rest days. I'm lucky I didn't get more
seriously beat up. Overall it was fun, but certainly doesn't qualify as
sensible.

I was able to take most of December off, and have only now just started running
base mileage again.

Given I missed my second target race I had been feeling pretty down about the
year, but in hindsight it went pretty well. I had 10-11 months of injury free
running and cycling, PR'ed my mile (5:34) and 5K (18:16), while getting in some
phenomenal destination runs and rides.

This year I also finished up my third and final year as coach for the [Golden Gate Running Club](https://goldengaterunningclub.org/). Time for some fresh ideas. Am looking forward to see what Will brings to the position!

## Projects

I didn't consciously practice anything consistently this year, but did try a few
new things near the beginning. Projects mostly fell off in the back half of the
year as work picked up.

#### Speedrunning

* Improved my Ori All Skills speedrun time from 38:25 to
  [35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIIGCzqg94g) after switching from
  controller to KBM while preparing for a tournament. Choked quite hard in said
  tournament, but goal was always just to participate.
* Live commentated one of the races in same tournament. This was the thing I
  did most outside my comfort zone this year, as measured by anxiety leading up
  to it! This was fun and gave me a lot of respect for good commentators.
* Routed a new category, [100% no OOB no
  TA](https://xaviershay.com/ori-100-noobta). It has inherent problems as a
  category so will never be popular, but was a fun exercise. As the first
  runner, held the WR for a few months!

#### Art

* Taught myself Blender, a 3D modeling tool. Made a [fire
  hydrant](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/JdaNZ) and a [motion tracked
  capture of my desk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8glR4HVlSk).
* Tried drawing with pen and paper for the first time. Drew some giraffes.
* Edited a home juggling video with my brother, [Stranger
  Throws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOvOs1ceqdw).

</center>

#### Programming

* Created a [map stitcher](https://github.com/xaviershay/ori-tracker/tree/master/MapStitcher) to create a ridiculously [high resolution Ori game map](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ui8ydu9elrg3wfy/ori-map-large.png?dl=0) (20,480 x 14,592px, 29Mb).
* Made a [proof-of-concept tracker](https://github.com/xaviershay/ori-tracker)
  to live display Ori locations on a map, for either documenting routes or for
  a live leaderboard for races. Used previous map as tiles for a map server,
  and was an excuse to learn more about [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
* Implemented the [Legendary card
  game](https://github.com/xaviershay/legendary-bench) as an API with web
  frontend, including a LISP-like language with type inference for specifying
  cards.
* Made a proof assistant for [Magic: The Gathering
  puzzles](http://possibilitystorm.com/),
  [Dovin](https://github.com/xaviershay/dovin).

## 2019

For running, I want to be smarter about my training rather than doing it
primarily by feel. I'm going to experiment with using an online coach, and try
using an [Oura ring](https://ouraring.com/) to better track recovery. I want to
run faster through consistent training and avoiding injury.

Project wise I don't have any plans. Am happy to see what happens. I'd like to
try streaming more, particularly programming. I've only done a little of this
and found it enjoyable.
