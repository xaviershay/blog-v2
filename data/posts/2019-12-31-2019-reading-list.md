I read forty books this year, fewer than normal. Not sure why, I still read every day. Usually I have a new specialist area or two that contribute a number of books to the list, but this year was more generic.

Top picks are below, and you can find the full list over [at
Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/2875383-xavier-shay?shelf=read&sort=date_read).
If you only read one, make it _We Are the Weather_.

## Fiction

#### Normal People _by Sally Rooney_

Can't believe I'm giving top marks to a book about awkward teenagers, but here we are.

> He finds himself rushing to the end of the conversation so they can hang up,
> and then he can retrospectively savour how much he likes seeing her, without
> the moment-to-moment pressure of having to produce the right expressions and
> say the right things.

#### King of Scars _by Leigh Bardugo_

Fun read of the year. Fresh fantasy with assertive characters.

#### Bright Shiny Morning _by James Frey_

A picture of LA, intertwining several characters from LA: a homeless alcoholic,
a narcissistic movie star,  a young couple having just moved and struggling to
survive. Frey's prose is unique and wonderful.

> Not all facts are fun. Some are, some are really fucking fun, but not all of
> them. Volume 1 of Facts Not So Fun Los Angeles.

## History

#### How to Hide an Empire _by Daniel Immerwahr_

Best history book I've read. Fast paced, interesting, and about a topic I don't
know much about: American colonies and conquests abroad such as the Philippines
and Puerto Rico.

> Since 1945, U.S. armed forces have been deployed abroad for conflicts or
> potential conflicts 211 times in 67 countries. Call it peacekeeping if you
> want, or call it imperialism. But clearly this is not a country that has kept
> its hands to itself.

#### Endurance _by Alfred Lansing_

The story of Ernest Shackleton's 1941 failed attempt to reach the South Pole.
Phenomenal story, well told, wouldn't be believable as fiction.

#### Age of Ambition _by Evan Osnos_

A recent history of China, told through stories from a wide cast of both
everyday and notorious Chinese people. Gave me new perspective, particularly
around censorship.

## Other Non-Fiction

#### How to Change Your Mind _by Michael Pollan_

Interesting history of psychedelics, with a particular focus on research
and healing communities (as distinct from say, _The Electric Kool-Aid Acid
Test_), along with the author's own personal introduction. The last five years
have seen a resurgence in research and very promising early results on treating
all sorts of things with psychedelics: depression, addiction, existential
anxiety in cancer patients.

#### Range _by David Epstein_

Surprisingly good, wasn't expecting so many new stories and research.
Particularly shocking and insightful for me was that positive student
evaluations of instructors has been found to be inversely correlated with long
term learning, and in general students misevaluate how well they have learned
with different techniques.

#### Between the World and Me _by Ta-Nehisi Coates_

Short and powerful.

> But all our phrasing—race relations, racial chasm, racial justice, racial
> profiling, white privilege, even white supremacy—serves to obscure that
> racism is a visceral experience, that it dislodges brains, blocks airways,
> rips muscle, extracts organs, cracks bones, breaks teeth. You must never look
> away from this.

#### We Are the Weather _by Jonathan Safran Foer_

Loved the author making a genuine attempt at introspecting his dissonance
between "I believe climate change is real" and "I am not changing my
behaviour".  It's directly written to people like me -- I already accept the
science ...  what now? Particularly enjoyed the socratic dialogue with his soul
in chapter 4, perhaps the only such dialogue I've felt was effective.

Surprisingly not so much about veganism, which was unexpected but welcome --
it is a much better and deeper book than "eating animals is bad for the
environment".

> If I’d read the previous sentences in high school, I’d have dismissed them as
> a bursting sack of self-serving bullshit—messiness of life?—and been deeply
> disappointed by the flimsy person I was to become. I’m glad that I was who I
> was then, and I hope that other young people have the same inflexible
> idealism. But I’m glad that I am who I am now, not because it is easier but
> because it is in better dialogue with my world, which is different from the
> world I occupied twenty-five years ago.
