A rather large collection of essays, presented in a nice cadence (similar essays together). Unfortunately, a non-trivial number of them required context I don't possess to understand. It is to Hitchens credit that I still felt these worth reading. The sections "Eclectic Affinities", "Amusements, Annoyances and Disappointments" and "Words' Worth" were the most readable; reviews of biographies/histories of authors I've never heard of the hardest.
