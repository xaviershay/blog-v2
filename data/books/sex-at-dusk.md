Early on reading "Sex at Dawn" I started hearing alarm bells. Something didn't feel right, but I wasn't familiar enough with the material to articulate it particularly well.

Enter this book, written in response and directly addressing the scientific claims made in "Sex at Dawn". Its primary criticisms, supported by large bodies of evidence, are:

* That's not how natural selection works.
* Bonobos aren't really like that.
* Those hunter-gatherer tribes aren't really like that.

It was a much more complex treatment of the material (real life is messy), but didn't pull any punches when they had to be thrown.
