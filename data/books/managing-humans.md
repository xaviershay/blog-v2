Easily digestible and some good food for thought, even though I've already read much of his writing online. I don't particularly like the style (blog) for long form books, however. (Seth Godin also does this also, but worse.)

This is the first book I've read on a kindle, that may have impacted my impressions (for better or worse.)

Aside: really badly proofed, maybe they OCR'ed it for the kindle version?
