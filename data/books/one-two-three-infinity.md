I'm usually right into this sort of book, but I ended up abandoning ~80% of way through. It's very wide in scope, trying to cover maths, micro- and macro- science. That's admirable, but I think I prefer to go deep on a single thing. I also didn't realise it was published in 1947, which combined with breadth and resulting shallowness meant I was already familiar with most of the material.

Feels harsh to give this two stars, since I was sincerely impressed at the scope, but I didn't finish it so them the breaks.
