I can't really criticize an academic book for being too academic, but it did go on at times. That's the problem with reading research papers back to back, you end up reading the same threats to validity and research methods over and over again. Still, some good research in here:

- Code review great at catching bugs.
- Coverage not great at predicting bugs, churn and team organization much better.
- Pairing is generally pretty good but not for all tasks.
- Programmers spend *heaps* of time communicating.
- And more, my recall is a bit hosed because I chained all 30-something chapters in the space of two plane trips.
