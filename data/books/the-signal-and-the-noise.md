Covers a lot of ground, from predicting elections, to earthquakes, to terrorism, to climate change. I gave an internal cheer when he brought up bayesian reasoning. Entertaining read, good insight into to which statistical methods apply when, and is very balanced in his presentation (recognizing what both sides of a debate do right and wrong).
