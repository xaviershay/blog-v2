Good amount of science, solid tips on keeping fuel up while dropping weight, from someone who has clearly been doing this for pro athletes for a long time. Food diaries from many pros at the end were funny - to my eye just looks like they eat all kind of shit.

I bought a scales but there isn't a heap of room for me to go - I've already dropped 20lbs since my lifting peak :/ Am tracking over time though so we'll see what happens.
