I read fifty-five books this year. I'm suprised at how high that number is,
since qualitatively this year was the least engaged I've felt with reading in a
number of years. Which in of itself was suprising: in February I quit my full
time job, and had expected that reading would fill some of the subsequent
space.

Top picks are below, and you can find the full list over [at
Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/2875383-xavier-shay?shelf=read&sort=date_read).

## Psychology

#### The Happiness Hypothesis _by Jonathan Haldt_

The author's second book _The Righteous Mind_ was my [pick of the year for
2015]({{ site.baseurl }}/articles/2015-reading-list.html), I have no idea why I
didn't check to see what else he had written earlier. It's a fantastic concept:
take wisdom from the old philosophers (e.g. "money can't buy you happiness")
and contrast it to what we know from modern psychology. Does a great job
normalizing therapy and drugs alongside meditation as appropriate techniques
for altering happiness.

> You can change your affective style too—but again, you can’t do it by sheer
> force of will. You have to do something that will change your repertoire of
> available thoughts. Here are three of the best methods for doing so:
> meditation, cognitive therapy, and Prozac.

## Sports

#### Endure _by Alex Hutchison_

A recent book summarizing much of the recent research around endurance,
specifically how psychological and biological factors are more intertwined than
previously thought. In particular, the section around separating dehydration
and heatstroke and treatment changed how I think about hydration.

> A 2013 meta-analysis in the British Journal of Sports Medicine concluded than
> any [water losses] of less than 4 percent are “very unlikely to impair
> [endurance performance] under real-world exercise conditions,” and concluded
> that athletes should be encouraged to drink according to thirst.

#### The Rise of Superman _by Steven Kotler_

From the billing I was expecting something more like the previous (_Endure_).
It's light on research and insights in that department, but is still an
entertaining history of extreme sports.

> I hope you talk a little about how utterly fucked we can become when we get
> too old or broken or smart to keep it up. Not all of us experience a happy
> life after doing this shit for a couple of decades.

#### Why Honor Matters _by Tammler Sommers_

Most fascinating book I read this year, contrasting the traditional western
liberal philosophic ethic with the much maligned/ignored ethic of honor. I gave
it a [full review]({{site.baseurl}}/articles/why-honor-matters-review.html)
separately.


## History

#### A Peoples' History of the United States _by Howard Zinn_

Does exactly what it sets out to do: a history from the perspective of regular
people, rather than statesmen. Particular things I found interesting:

* History of the labour movement in the 1800s, continuing through the 1900s.
* Recurring theme of expansion to find new markets for products.
* Context around the US entering WW2 and subsequent wars.

The author admits in an afterword that it is weak particularly with regard to
latina influence in the western states and LGBT history, though provides
recommended reading to fill those gaps.

#### Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City _by Matthew Desmond_

Phenomenal ethnography following the stories of a number of tenants and a
landlord in Milwaukee.

#### Janesville: An American Story _by Amy Goldstein_

Janesville was proudly the site of GM's oldest car factory, until it shut down
in 2008. _Janesville: An American Story_ follows a number of citizens of
Janesville through the following years as the town and its people try to
reinvent themselves. I wrote a [full review]({{ site.baseurl }}/articles/janesville-review.html) of this separately.

## Management

#### Reinventing Organizations _by Frederix Laloux_

Runner up for most thought-provoking book of the year. _Reinventing
Organizations_ is a survey of practices from 100+ person companies across many
industries that have done away with traditional management structures. I gave
it a [full
review]({{site.baseurl}}/articles/reinventing-organizations-review.html)
separately.


## Other Non-fiction

#### The Most Human Human _by Brian Christian_

The author becomes a human confederate in the Loebner Prize (an annual turing-test
competition), competing for the "most human human" award. Who can best convince
other humans that they are, in fact, human? He uses the experience as a
launching pad to write a delightful extended philosophic book about what it
means to be human.

#### Lab Girl _by Hope Jahren_

Beautiful memoir of a scientist. Great blend of science and personal stories,
covering an interesting life setting up multiple laboratories across the US.

## Fiction

I don't feel like I read much standout fiction this year, but two longer reads
were worth my time.

#### Aurora _by Kim Stanley Robinson_

Last year I reviewed _Seveneves_ as an "earnest book about space that doesn't
move very fast". _Aurora_ is similar, but with more of an exploration theme.
Unfortunately, I can't talk about why it made this list without spoilers, but
I'd love to see more sci-fi like this.

#### Cryptonomicon _by Neal Stephenson_

Neal Stephenson gets on the list for the second year running, as I'm slowly
working through his back catalog. This book was exactly what I've come to
expect and enjoy: tight writing, cracking plot, and zero character depth or
development. Like _Snow Crash_ except didn't peter out half way.

## Bonus: Let's Learn!

Quick and easy introductions to topics you may not have thought much about
before.

#### Asteroid Hunters _by Carrie Nugent_

How do we find new asteroids? Who is doing it? Who pays for it? How do we track
them? Are they going to hit us? Read this book and you will learn!

#### Exoplanets _by Michael Summers and James S. Trefil_

Same, but for planets outside our solar system. Mind-blowing: "Since its 2009 launch, the Kepler satellite has discovered more than two thousand exoplanets[!]"

#### Extra Virginity: The Sublime and Scandalous World of Olive Oil _by Tom Mueller_

Fraud is endemic in the olive oil industry and the Extra Virgin Olive Oil you
bought at the supermarket most likely isn't.
