First 90% was a full five stars. Fantasy world but with no overt magic or crazy shit, just a woman waging economic warfare. A+.

Could have just cut the ending off and it would of work. Instead, went too House of Cards. Maybe a good sequel could rectify and bring back that 5th star.

REREAD: Started reading the sequel but couldn't remember enough for it to make sense, so reread this. I bought the ending much more, felt much better supported now I knew it was coming.
