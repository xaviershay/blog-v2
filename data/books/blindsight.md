  <blockquote>Do you want to know what consciousness is for? Do you want to know the only real purpose it serves? Training wheels. You can't see both aspects of the Necker Cube at once, so it lets you focus on one and dismiss the other. That's a pretty halfâ€“assed way to parse reality. You're always better off looking at more than one side of anything. Go on, try. Defocus. It's the next logical step.</blockquote>
