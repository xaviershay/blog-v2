Really sensible book on running form and running well - I'll recommend this to beginners for sure.

Didn't feel as applicable for the speed I'm running, or at least that wasn't called out - fastest mentioned pace was 6:50 mile and there was an asterisk for elite runners needing to use legs more. Did pick up a sideways running trick for non-runnable hills, which if it works will be worth the price of admission alone.
