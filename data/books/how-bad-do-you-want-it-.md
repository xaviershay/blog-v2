Best sports book this year so far. Have been recommending to everyone.

"One cannot improve as an endurance athlete except by changing one’s relationship with perception of effort."

"Sure, it was just a race, but sports are not really separate from life, nor is the athlete distinct from the person."

"endurance racing as “a test of you as a person on top of a test of you as an athlete.”"

"There is no experience quite like that of driving yourself to the point of wanting to give up and then not giving up."

"THE SCIENTIFIC TERM for choking is “choking.” Psychologists haven’t come up with anything that sounds more clinical."

“A day without running is not a good day,”
