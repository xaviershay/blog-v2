An obscence, disgusting, squirming book that I cannot in good conscience
recommend to anyone but was nevertheless brilliant.

On shame:

> Here finally Kant perceives the true rift between them: Julian doesn’t know
> the difference between embarrassment and shame. How shame soaks, stains,
> leaves a skidmark on everything and, when it has nothing to stick to, spreads
> until it does. Embarrassment is contained by incidents, gets funny and small
> over time; shame runs gangrene through the entire past, makes the future
> impossible. You can’t own it or laugh it off, only try to bail it out in
> sloshing bucketfuls, drenching yourself in the process. Embarrassment is an
> event, shame a condition, one that Julian has somehow either mastered or
> never experienced, which explains why he’s so easygoing, and why, to him, the
> world is so tractable, why all seems fixable with talk.

Pitch-perfect description of modern day Twitter:

> Which is why I loved Twitter: an open, rhizomatic forum where you could
> aggravate existing mental illnesses, shop for new ones, violate your Miranda
> rights, and get fired. A place to be judged on the character of your content,
> driven by rubbernecking and spite, where fame is a millstone and names are
> bad op-sec. Twitter was the right word for it, birdsong being a Darwinian
> squall mistaken for idle chatter, screaming for territory and mates. An
> improv class, press conference, intervention, Klan rally, comics convention,
> and struggle session all booked in the same conference room. A crowded
> elevator where anyone who smelled a fart also had to fart. Each post was an
> arrow fired blind into the sky, and if it hit something, ten thousand arrows
> shrieked back down and called you a cunt.

And on similar public-square themes:

> All these downstream consequences of the great gulf between what humans and
> computers consider a large number.
