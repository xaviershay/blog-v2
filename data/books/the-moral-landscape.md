I am consistently impressed by Harris' ability to clearly lay out and investigate an argument. Takeaways:

* Brain imaging shows no difference in activity between considering truth of "beliefs", "values" and "facts".
* Morals can be thought of as being similar to health in that: you can't really measure it well, people often act in ways that are not healthy, yet we can still use science to learn about it.

Here is a critical review from someone who has actually read the book and isn't insane: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="http://jetpress.org/v21/blackford3.htm">http://jetpress.org/v21/blackford3.htm</a>
