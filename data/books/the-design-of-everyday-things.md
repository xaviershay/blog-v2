Required reading for anyone who makes things. Goes in depth on the "trauma of everyday life" caused by poor design in such common items as doors, radios, and the kitchen sink. Provides many techniques and heuristics for designing useable objects and systems.

Took me a while to finish only because I was reading a real book and it wasn't on my kindle.
